PREFACE</h2>

<p class="indent">
The object aimed at in the following pages has been to offer to
the general reader a plain account of the wonderful investigations
which have revolutionized all ideas as to the antiquity and the
level of the earliest European culture, and to endeavour to make
intelligible the bearing and significance of the results of these
investigations. In the hope that the extraordinary resurrection
of the first European civilization may appeal to a more extended
constituency than that of professed students of ancient origins,
the book has been kept as free as possible from technicalities
and the discussion of controverted points; and throughout I have
endeavoured to write for those who, while from their school days
they have loved the noble and romantic story of Ancient Greece,
have been denied the opportunity of a more thorough study of it
than comes within the limits of an ordinary education.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In the first chapter this standpoint may seem to have been unduly
emphasized, and the retelling of the ancient legends may be accounted
mere surplusage. Such, no doubt, it will be to some readers, but
perhaps they may be balanced by others whose <a name="page_viii"><span
class="page">Page viii</span></a> recollection of the great stories
of Classic Greece has grown a little faint with the lapse of years,
and who are not unwilling to have it prompted again. Reference to
the legends was in any case unavoidable, since one of the most
remarkable results of the explorations has been the disclosure of
the solid basis of historic fact on which they rested; and, if
the book was to accomplish its purpose for the readers for whom
it was designed, reference seemed almost necessarily to involve
retelling.
</p>

<p class="indent">
I have to acknowledge extensive obligations to the writings and
reports of the various investigators who have accomplished so wonderful
a resurrection of this ancient world. My debt to the works of Dr.
A. J. Evans will be manifest to all who have any acquaintance with
the subject; but to such authors as Mrs. H. B. Hawes, Dr. Mackenzie,
Professors Burrows, Murray, and Browne, and Messrs. D. G. Hogarth
and H. R. Hall, to name only a few among many, my obligations are
only less than to the acknowledged chief of Cretan explorers.
</p>

<p class="indent">
To the Rev. James Kennedy, D.D., librarian of the New College,
Edinburgh, and to the Rev. C. J. M. Middleton, M.A., Crailing,
my thanks are due for invaluable help afforded in the collection
of material, and I have been not less indebted to Mr. A. Brown,
Galashiels, and to Messrs. C. H. Brown and C. R. A. Howden, Edinburgh,
and others, for their assistance in the preparation of the
illustrations. To Mr. A. Brown in particular are due plates II.,
III., IV., V., IX., X., XV., XVI., XX., <a name="page_ix"><span
class="page">Page ix</span></a> XXIII., XXIV., and XXV.; and to
Messrs. C. H. Brown and C. R. A. Howden Plates I., VII., VIII.,
XI., XII., XVII. (I), and XXI. I have to record my hearty thanks
to the Council of the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies
for the use of Plates XXIX. and XXX., reproduced by their permission
from the <i>Journal of Hellenic Studies</i>; to the Committee of
the British School at Athens for the use of Plate XIX. and the plan
of Knossos from their <i>Annual</i>; and to Dr. A. J. Evans and
Mr. John Murray for Plates VI., XIII., and XIV., from the <i>Monthly
Review</i>, March, 1901. For the redrawing and adaptation of the
plan of Knossos I am indebted to Mr. H. Baikie, B.Sc., Edinburgh,
and for the sketch-map of Crete to my wife.

PREHISTORIC CIVILIZATION OF GREECE
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="subtitle">THE LEGENDS</p>

<p class="indent">
The resurrection of the prehistoric age of Greece, and the disclosure
of the astonishing standard of civilization which had been attained
on the mainland and in the isles of the &AElig;gean at a period
at least 2,000 years earlier than that at which Greek history,
as hitherto understood, begins, may be reckoned as among the most
interesting results of modern research into the relics of the life
of past ages. The present generation has witnessed remarkable
discoveries in Mesopotamia and in Egypt, but neither Niffur nor
Abydos disclosed a world so entirely new and unexpected as that
which has been revealed by the work of Schliemann and his successors
at Troy, Mycen&aelig;, and Tiryns, and by that of Evans and the other
explorers&mdash;Italian, British, and American&mdash;in Crete. The
Mesopotamian and Egyptian discoveries traced back a little farther
streams which had already been followed far up <a name="page_2"><span
class="page">Page 2</span></a> their course; those of Schliemann and
Evans revealed the reality of one which, so to speak, had hitherto
been believed to flow only through the dreamland of legend. It
was obvious that mighty men must have existed before Agamemnon,
but what manner of men they were, and in what manner of world they
lived, were matters absolutely unknown, and, to all appearance,
likely to remain so. An abundant wealth of legend told of great Kings
and heroes, of stately palaces, and mighty armies, and powerful
fleets, and the whole material of an advanced civilization. But
the legends were manifestly largely imaginative&mdash;deities and
demi-gods, men and fabulous monsters, were mingled in them on the
same plane&mdash;and it seemed impossible that we should ever get
back to the solid ground, if solid ground had ever existed, on which
these ancient stories first rested.
</p>

<p class="indent">
For the historian of the middle of the nineteenth century Greek
history began with the First Olympiad in 776 B.C. Before that the
story of the return of the Herakleids and the Dorian conquest of
the men of the Bronze Age might very probably embody, in a fanciful
form, a genuine historical fact; the Homeric poems were to be treated
with respect, not only on account of their supreme poetical merit,
but as possibly representing a credible tradition, though, of course,
their pictures of advanced civilization were more or less imaginative
projections upon the past of the culture of the writer's own period or
periods. Beyond that lay the great waste land of <a name="page_3"><span
class="page">Page 3</span></a> legend, in which gods and godlike
heroes moved and enacted their romances among 'Gorgons and Hydras
and Chimeras dire.' What proportion of fact, if any, lay in the
stories of Minos, the great lawgiver, and his war fleet, and his
Labyrinth, with its monstrous occupant; of Theseus and Ariadne
and the Minotaur; of D&aelig;dalus, the first aeronaut, and his
wonderful works of art and science; or of any other of the thousand
and one beautiful or tragic romances of ancient Hellas, to attempt
to determine this lay utterly beyond the sphere of the serious
historian. 'To analyze the fables,' says Grote, 'and to elicit from
them any trustworthy particular facts, appears to me a fruitless
attempt. The religious recollections, the romantic inventions, and
the items of matter of fact, <i>if any such there be</i>, must
for ever remain indissolubly amalgamated, as the poet originally
blended them, for the amusement or edification of his auditors....
It was one of the agreeable dreams of the Grecian epic that the
man who travelled far enough northward beyond the Rhiph&aelig;an
Mountains would in time reach the delicious country and genial
climate of the virtuous Hyperboreans, the votaries and favourites
of Apollo, who dwelt in the extreme north, beyond the chilling blasts
of Boreas. Now, the hope that we may, by carrying our researches up
the stream of time, exhaust the limits of fiction, and land ultimately
upon some points of solid truth, appears to me no less illusory
than this northward journey in quest of the Hyperborean elysium.'
Grote's frankly sceptical <a name="page_4"><span class="page">Page
4</span></a> attitude represents fairly well the general opinion
of the middle of last century. The myths were beautiful, but their
value was not in any sense historical; it arose from the light
which they cast upon the workings of the active Greek mind, and
the revelation which they gave of the innate poetic faculty which
created myths so far excelling those of any other nation.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Within the last forty years all this has been changed. Opinions
like that so dogmatically expressed by our great historian are
no longer held by anyone who has followed the current of modern
investigations, and remain only as monuments of the danger of
dogmatizing on matters concerning which all preconceived ideas
may be upset by the results of a single season's spade-work on
some ancient site; and he would be a bold man who would venture
to-day to call 'illusory' the search for 'points of solid truth'
in the old legends, or to assert that 'the items of matter of fact,
if any such there be,' are inextricable from the mass of romantic
inventions in which they are embedded. The work, of course, is by
no means complete; very probably it is scarcely more than well
begun; but already the dark gulf of time that lay behind the Dorian
conquest is beginning to yield up the unquestionable evidences of
a great, and splendid, and almost incredibly ancient civilization,
which neither for its antiquity nor for its actual attainment has
any cause to shrink from comparison with the great historic
civilizations of Mesopotamia or the Nile Valley; and while the
process <a name="page_5"><span class="page">Page 5</span></a> of
disentangling the historic nucleus of the legends from their merely
mythical and romantic elements cannot yet be undertaken with any
approach to certainty, it is becoming continually more apparent,
not only that in many cases there was such a nucleus, but also
what were some of the historic elements around which the poetic
fancy of later times drew the fanciful wrappings of the heroic
tales as we know them. It is not yet possible to trace and identify
the actual figures of the heroes of prehistoric Greece: probably
it never will be possible, unless the as yet untranslated Cretan
script should furnish the records of a more ancient Herodotus,
and a new Champollion should arise to decipher them; but there
can scarcely be any reasonable doubt that genuine men and women of
&AElig;gean stock filled the r&ocirc;les of these ancient romances,
and that the wondrous story of their deeds is, in part at least,
the record of actual achievements.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In this remarkable resurrection of the past the most important and
convincing part has been played by the evidence from Crete. The
discoveries which were made during the last quarter of the nineteenth
century by Schliemann and his successors at Mycenc&aelig;, Tiryns,
Orchomenos, and elsewhere, were quite conclusive as to the former
existence of a civilization quite equal to, and in all probability
the original of, that which is described for us in the Homeric poems;
but it was not until the treasures of Knossos and Ph&aelig;stos began
to be revealed in 1900 and the subsequent years that it became manifest
that what was known as the Mycen&aelig;an <a name="page_6"><span
class="page">Page 6</span></a> civilization was itself only the
decadence of a far richer and fuller culture, whose fountain-head
and whose chief sphere of development had been in Crete. And it
has been in Crete that exploration and discovery have led to the
most striking illustration of many of the statements in the legends
and traditions, and have made it practically certain that much of
what used to be considered mere romantic fable represents, with,
of course, many embellishments of fancy, a good deal of historic
fact.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Our first task, therefore, is to gather together the main features
of what the ancient legends of Greece narrated about Crete and its
inhabitants, and their relations to the rest of the &AElig;gean
world. The position of Crete&mdash;'a halfway house between three
continents, flanked by the great Libyan promontory, and linked by
smaller island stepping-stones to the Peloponnese and the mainland
of Anatolia'&mdash;marks it out as designed by Nature to be a centre
of development in the culture of the early &AElig;gean race, and,
in point of fact, ancient traditions unanimously pointed to the
great island as being the birthplace of Greek civilization. The
most ambitious tradition boldly transcended the limits of human
occupation, and gave to Divinity itself a place of nurture in the
fastnesses of the Cretan mountains. That many-sided deity, the
supreme god of the Greek theology, had in one of his aspects a
special connection with the island. The great son of Kronos and
Rhea, threatened by his unnatural father with the same doom which
had overtaken his brethren, was said <a name="page_7"><span
class="page">Page 7</span></a> to have been saved by his mother,
who substituted for him a stone, which her unsuspecting spouse
devoured, thinking it to be his son. Rhea fled to Crete to bear
her son, either in the Id&aelig;an or the Dict&aelig;an cave, where
he was nourished with honey and goat's milk by the nymph Amaltheia
until the time was ripe for his vengeance upon his father. (It
has been suggested that in this somewhat grotesque legend we have
a parabolic representation of one of the great religious facts of
that ancient world&mdash;the supersession by the new anthropomorphic
faith of the older cult, whose objects of adoration, made without
hands, and devoid of human likeness, were sacred stones or trees.
Kronos, the representative of the old faith, clung to his sacred
stone, while the new human God was being born, before whose worship
the ancient cult of the pillar and the tree should pass away.)
</p>

<p class="indent">
In the Dict&aelig;an cave, also, Zeus grown to maturity, was united
to Europa, the daughter of man, in the sacred marriage from which
sprang Minos, the great legendary figure of Crete. And to Crete
the island god returned to close his divine life. Primitive legend
asserted that his tomb was on Mount Juktas, the conical hill which
overlooks the ruins of the city of Minos, his son, his friend, and
his priest. It was this surprising claim of the Cretans to possess
the burial-place of the supreme God of Hellas which first attached
to them the unenviable reputation for falsehood which clung to them
throughout the classical period, and was <a name="page_8"><span
class="page">Page 8</span></a> crystallized by Callimachus in the
form adopted by St. Paul in the Epistle to Titus&mdash;'The Cretans
are alway liars.'
</p>

<p class="indent">
It is round Minos, the son of Zeus and Europa, that the bulk of
the Cretan legends gathers. The suggestion has been made, with
great probability, that the name Minos is not so much the name
of a single person as the title of a race of kings. 'I suspect,'
says Professor Murray, 'that Minos was a name, like "Pharaoh" or
"C&aelig;sar," given to all Cretan Kings of a certain type.' With
that, however, we need not concern ourselves at present, further
than to notice that the bearer of the name appears in the legends
in many different characters, scarcely consistent with one another,
or with his being a single person. According to the story, Minos is
not only the son but also the 'gossip' of Zeus; he is, like Abraham,
'the friend of God.' He receives from the hand of God, like another
Moses, the code of laws which becomes the basis of all subsequent
legislation; he holds frequent and familiar intercourse with God,
and, once in every nine years, he goes up to the Dict&aelig;an cave
of the Bull-God 'to converse with Zeus,' to receive new commandments,
and to give account of his stewardship during the intervening period.
Finally, at the close of his life, he is transferred to the underworld,
and the great human lawgiver becomes the judge of the dead in Hades.
</p>

<p class="indent">
That is one side of the Minos legend, perhaps the most ancient;
but along with it there exists another <a name="page_9"><span
class="page">Page 9</span></a> group of stories of a very different
character, so different as to lend colour to the suggestion that
we are now dealing, not with the individual Minos who first gave
the name its vogue, but with a successor or successors in the same
title. The Minos who is most familiar to us in Greek story is not
so much the lawgiver and priest of God as the great sea-King and
tyrant, the overlord of the &AElig;gean, whose vengeance was defeated
by the bravery of the Athenian hero, Theseus. From this point of
view, Minos was the first of men who recognized the importance of
sea-power, and used it to establish the supremacy of his island
kingdom. 'The first person known to us as having established a
navy,' says Thucydides, 'is Minos. He made himself master of what
is now called the Hellenic sea, and ruled over the Cyclades, into
most of which he sent the first colonies, expelling the Carians,
and appointing his own sons governors; and thus did his best to
put down piracy in those waters, a necessary step to secure the
revenues for his own use.' To Herodotus also, Minos, though obviously
a shadowy figure, is the first great Thalassokrat. 'Polykrates
is the first of the Grecians of whom we know who formed a design
to make himself master of the sea, except Minos the Knossian.'
But the evidence for the existence of this early Sea-King and his
power rests on surer grounds than the vague tradition recorded by
the two great historians. The power of Minos has left its imprint
in unmistakable fashion in the places which were called by his
name. Each of the <a name="page_10"><span class="page">Page
10</span></a> Minoas which appear so numerously on the coasts of
the Mediterranean, from Sicily on the west to Gaza on the east,
marks a spot where the King or Kings who bore the name of Minos
once held a garrison or a trading-station, and their number shows
how wide-reaching was the power of the Cretan sea-Kings.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But the great King was by no means so fortunate in his domestic
relationships as in his foreign adventures. The domestic skeleton
in his case was the composite monster the Minotaur, half man, half
bull, fabled to have been the fruit of a monstrous passion on the
part of the King's wife, Pasiphae. This monster was kept shut up
within a vast and intricate building called the Labyrinth, contrived
for Minos by his renowned artificer, D&aelig;dalus. Further, when his
own son, Androgeos, had gone to Athens to contend in the Panathenaic
games, having overcome all the other Greeks in the sports, he fell
a victim to the suspicion of &AElig;geus, the King of Athens, who
caused him to be slain, either by waylaying him on the road to
Thebes, or by sending him against the Marathonian bull. In his
sorrow and righteous anger, Minos, who had already conquered Megara
by the treachery of Scylla, raised a great fleet, and levied war
upon Athens; and, having wasted Attica with fire and sword, he
at length reduced the land to such straits that King &AElig;geus
and his Athenians were glad to submit to the hard terms which were
asked of them. The demand of Minos was that every ninth year Athens
should <a name="page_11"><span class="page">Page 11</span></a>
send him as tribute seven youths and seven maidens. These were
selected by lot, or, according to another version of the legend,
chosen by Minos himself, and on their arrival in Crete were cast
into the Labyrinth, to become the prey of the monstrous Minotaur.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The first and second instalments of this ghastly tribute had already
been paid; but when the time of the third tribute was drawing nigh,
the predestined deliverer of Athens appeared in the person of the
hero Theseus. Theseus was the unacknowledged son of King &AElig;geus
and the Princess Aithra of Tr&oelig;zen. He had been brought up by his
mother at Tr&oelig;zen, and on arriving at early manhood had set out to
make his way to the Court of &AElig;geus and secure acknowledgment
as the rightful son of the Athenian King. The legend tells how on
his way to Athens he cleared the lands through which he journeyed
of the pests which had infested them. Sinnis, the pine-bender,
who tied his miserable victims to the tops of two pine-trees bent
towards one another and then allowed the trees to spring back,
the young hero dealt with as he had dealt with others; Kerkuon,
the wrestler, was slain by him in a wrestling bout; Procrustes,
who enticed travellers to his house and made them fit his bed,
stretching the short upon the rack and lopping the limbs of the
over-tall, had his own measure meted to him; and various other
plagues of society were abated by the young hero. Not long after his
arrival at Athens and acknowledgment by his <a name="page_12"><span
class="page">Page 12</span></a> father, the time came round when
the Minoan heralds should come to Athens to claim the victims for
the Minotaur. Seeing the grief that prevailed in the city, and the
anger of the people against his father, &AElig;geus, whom they
accounted the cause of their misfortune, Theseus determined that,
if possible, he would make an end of this humiliation and misery,
and accordingly offered himself as one of the seven youths who
were to be devoted to the Minotaur. &AElig;geus was loth to part
with his newly-found son, but at length he consented to the venture;
and it was agreed that if Theseus succeeded in vanquishing the
Minotaur and bringing back his comrades in safety, he should hoist
white sails on his returning galley instead of the black ones which
she had always borne in token of her melancholy mission.
</p>

<p class="indent">
So at length the sorrowful ship came to the harbour in the bay below
broad Knossos where Minos reigned, and when the King had viewed
his captives they were cast into prison to await their dreadful
doom. But fair-haired Ariadne, the daughter of Minos, had marked
Theseus as he stood before the King, and love to him had risen
up in her heart, and pity at the thought of his fate; and so by
night she came to his dungeon, and when she could not persuade him
to save himself by flight, because that he had sworn to kill the
Minotaur and save his companions, she gave him a clue of thread by
which he might be able to retrace his way through all the dark and
winding passages of the <a name="page_13"><span class="page">Page
13</span></a> Labyrinth, and a sword wherewith to deal with the
Minotaur when he encountered him. So Theseus was led away by the
guards, and put into the Labyrinth to meet his fate; and he went
on, with the clue which he had fastened to his arm unwinding itself
as he passed through passage after passage, until at last he met
the dreadful monster; and there, in the depths of the Labyrinth,
the Minotaur, who had slain so many, was himself slain. Then Theseus
and his companions escaped, taking Ariadne with them, and fled to
their black ship, and set sail for Attica again; and landing for
awhile in the island of Naxos, Ariadne there became the hero's
wife. But she never came to Athens with Theseus, but was either
deserted by him in Naxos, or, as some say, was taken from him there
by force. So, without her, Theseus sailed again for Athens. But
in their excitement at the hope of seeing once more the home they
had thought to have looked their last upon, he and his companions
forgot to hoist the white sail; and old &AElig;geus, straining his
eyes on Sunium day after day for the returning ship, saw her at
last come back black-winged as he had feared; and in his grief he
fell, or cast himself, into the sea, and so died, and thus the sea
is called the &AElig;gean to this day. Another tradition, recorded
by the poet Bacchylides, tells how Theseus, at the challenge of
Minos, descended to the palace of Amphitrite below the sea, and
brought back with him the ring, 'the splendour of gold,' which
the King had thrown into the deep.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_14"><span class="page">Page 14</span></a> So runs
the great story which links Minos and Crete with the favourite
hero of Athens. But other legends, not so famous nor so romantic,
carry on the story of the great Cretan King to a miserable close.
D&aelig;dalus, his famous artificer, was also an Athenian, and
the most cunning of all men. To him was ascribed the invention
of the plumb-line and the auger, the wedge and the level; and it
was he who first set masts in ships and bent sails upon them. But
having slain, through jealousy, his nephew Perdix, who promised
to excel him in skill, he was forced to flee from Athens, and so
came to the Court of Minos. For the Cretan King he wrought many
wonderful works, rearing for him the Labyrinth, and the Choros,
or dancing-ground, which, as Homer tells us, he 'wrought in broad
Knossos for fair-haired Ariadne.' But for his share in the great
crime of Pasiphae Minos hated him, and shut him up in the Labyrinth
which he himself had made. Then D&aelig;dalus made wings for himself
and his son Icarus, and fastened them with wax, and together the
two flew from their prison-house high above the pursuit of the
King's warfleet. But Icarus flew too near the sun, and the wax
that fastened his wings melted, and he fell into the sea. So
D&aelig;dalus alone came safely to Sicily, and was there hospitably
received by King Kokalos of Kamikos, for whom, as for Minos, he
executed many marvellous works. Then Minos, still thirsting for
revenge, sailed with his fleet for Kamikos, to demand the surrender of
D&aelig;dalus; and Kokalos, <a name="page_15"><span class="page">Page
15</span></a> affecting willingness to give up the fugitive, received
Minos with seeming friendship, and ordered the bath to be prepared
for his royal guest. But the three daughters of the Sicilian King,
eager to protect D&aelig;dalus, drowned the Cretan in the bath,
and so he perished miserably. And many of the men who had sailed
with him remained in Sicily, and founded there a town which they
named Minoa, in memory of their murdered King.

<p class="indent">
Herodotus has preserved for us another echo of the story of Minos
in the shape of the reasons which led the Cretans to refuse aid to
the rest of the Greeks during the Persian invasion. The Delphian
oracle, which they consulted at this crisis, suggested to them that
they had known enough of the misery caused by foreign expeditions.
'Fools, you complain of all the woes that Minos in his anger sent you,
for aiding Menelaus, because they would not assist you in avenging
his death at Kamikos, and yet you assisted them in avenging a woman
who was carried off from Sparta by a barbarian.' In commentary
on this saying Herodotus gives the explanation which was given
to him by the inhabitants of Pr&aelig;sos, in Crete. After the
death of Minos, the Cretans, with a great armada, invaded Sicily,
and besieged Kamikos ineffectually for five years; but finding
themselves unable to continue the siege, and being driven ashore
on the Italian coast during their retreat, they founded there the
city of Hyria. Crete, being thus left desolate, was repeopled by
other tribes, 'especially the Grecians'; <a name="page_16"><span
class="page">Page 16</span></a> and in the third generation after
the death of Minos the new Cretan people sent a contingent to help
Agamemnon in the Trojan War, as a punishment for which famine and
pestilence fell on them, and the island was depopulated a second
time, so that the Cretans of the time of the Persian invasion are
the third race to inhabit the island. In this tradition we may
see a distorted reflection of the various vicissitudes which, as
we shall see later, appear to have befallen the Minoan kingdom,
and of the incursions which, after the fall of Knossos, gradually
changed the character of the island population.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Such, then, are the most familiar of the legends and traditions
associated with prehistoric Crete. Some of these, touching on the
personality of Minos and his relationship with Zeus, have their
own significance in connection with the little that is known of
the Minoan religion, and will fall to be discussed later from that
point of view. The famous story of Theseus and the Minotaur, though
it, too, may have its connection with the religious conceptions which
gather round the name of Minos, seems at first sight to move entirely
in the realm of pure romance. Yet the conviction of its reality was
very strong with the Athenians, and was indeed expressed in a ceremony
which held its own to a late stage in Athenian history. The ship in
which Theseus was said to pave made his voyage was preserved with
the utmost care till at least the beginning of the third century
B.C., her timbers being constantly 'so pieced and new-framed with
strong plank that it <a name="page_17"><span class="page">Page
17</span></a> afforded an example to the philosophers in their
disputations concerning the identity of things that are changed by
growth, some contending that it was the same, and others that it
was not.' It was this galley, or the vessel which tradition affirmed
to be the galley of Theseus, which was sent every year from Athens
to Delos with solemn sacrifices and specially nominated envoys.
One of her voyages has become for ever memorable owing to the fact
that the death of Socrates was postponed for thirty days because
of the galley's absence; for so great was the reverence in which
this annual ceremony was held that during the time of her voyage
the city was obliged to abstain from all acts carrying with them
public impurity, so that it was not lawful to put a condemned man to
death until the galley returned. The mere fact of such a tradition
as that of the galley is at least presumptive evidence that some
historic ground lay behind a belief so persistent, however the
story may have been added to and adorned with supernatural details
by later imagination; and it is difficult to see how Grote, on
the very threshold of recounting the Athenians' conviction about
the ship, and their solemn sacrificial use of her, should pause to
reaffirm his unbelief in the existence of any historic ground for
the main feature of the legend&mdash;the tribute of human victims
paid by Athens to Crete.

<p class="indent">
Later Athenian writers of a rationalizing turn endeavoured to bring
down the noble old legend to the level of the commonplace by
transforming <a name="page_18"><span class="page">Page 18</span></a>
the Minotaur into a mere general or famous athlete named Taurus,
whom Theseus vanquished in Crete. But the rationalistic version
never found much favour, and the Athenian potter was always sure
of a market for his vases with pictures of the bull-headed Minotaur
falling to the sword of the national hero. No more fortunate has been
the German attempt to resolve the story of Minos and the Minotaur,
the Labyrinth and Pasiphae, into a clumsy solar myth. The whole legend
of the Minotaur, on this theory, was connected with the worship of
the heavenly host. The Minotaur was the Sun; Pasiphae, 'the very
bright one,' wife of Minos, was the Moon; and the Labyrinth was
the tower on whose walls the astronomers of the day traced the
wanderings of the heavenly bodies, 'an image of the starry heaven,
with its infinitely winding paths, in which, nevertheless, the sun
and moon so surely move about.' Among rationalizing explanations
this must surely hold the palm for cumbrousness and complexity,
and we may be thankful that the explorer's spade has demolished
it along with other theories, and given back to us, as we shall
see, at least the elements of a romance such as that which was
so dear to the Athenian public.

CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="subtitle">THE HOMERIC CIVILIZATION</p>

<p class="indent">
Between the Greece of such legends as those which we have been
considering and the Greece of the earliest historic period there
has always been a great gulf of darkness. On the one side a land
of seemingly fabulous Kings and heroes and monsters, of fabulous
palaces and cities; on the other side. Greece as we know it in the
infant stages of its development, with a totally different state
of society, a totally different organization and culture; and in the
interval no one could say how many generations, concerning which,
and their conditions and developments, there was nothing but blank
ignorance. So that it seemed as though the marvellous fabric of
Greek civilization as we know it were indeed something unexampled,
rising almost at once out of nothing to its height of splendour,
as the walls of Ilium were fabled to have risen beneath the hands
of their divine builders. Indeed, a certain section of students
seemed rather to glory in the fact of this seeming isolation of
Greek culture, and to deem it little short of profanity to seek any
pre-existing <a name="page_20"><span class="page">Page 20</span></a>
sources for it. 'The fathering of the Greek on the pre-existing
profane cultures has been scouted by perfervid Hellenists in terms
which implied that they hold it little else than impiety. Allowing
no causation more earthly than vague local influences of air and
light, mountain and sea, they would have Hellenism born into the
world by a miracle of generation, like its own Athena from the head
of Zeus.'[*] But a great civilization can never be accounted for
in this miraculous fashion. The origins of even Egyptian culture
have begun to yield themselves to patient research, and it is not
permissible to believe that the Greek nation was born in a day into
its great inheritance, or that it derived nothing from earlier
ages and races.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote *: D. G. Hogarth, 'Ionia and the East,' p. 21.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Indeed, the supreme monument of the matchless literature of Hellas
bore witness to the fact that, prior to the beginnings of Greek
history, there had existed on Greek soil a civilization of a very
high type, differing from, in some respects even superior to, that
which succeeded it, but manifestly refusing to be left out of
consideration in any attempt to describe the beginnings of Greek
culture. The Homeric poems shone like a beacon light across the
dark gulf which separated the Hellas of myth from the Hellas of
history, testifying to a splendour that had been before the darkness,
and prophesying of a splendour that should be when the darkness had
passed. But the very brilliance of their pictures and the magnificence
of the society with which they dealt <a name="page_21"><span
class="page">Page 21</span></a> only added to the complication
of the question, and emphasized the difficulty of deriving the
culture of historic Greece by legitimate filiation from a past
which seemed to have no connection and no community of character
with it. For the Homeric civilization was not a different stage
of development of that same civilization which appears when the
first beginnings of what we are accustomed to call Hellenism are
presented to us; it was totally diverse, and in many respects more
complex and more splendid.
</p>

<p class="indent">
From the eighth century onwards we are on moderately safe ground
when dealing with the history of Hellas and its culture. We know
something of the actual facts of its history, literary and political.
The chronicles of the more important cities are known with a
definiteness fairly comparable to what we might expect at such
a stage of development. But the Homeric poems take us away from
all that into a world in which a totally different state of things
prevails. The very geography is not that of the historical Hellenic
period. The names that are familiar to us as those of the chief
Greek cities and states are of comparatively minor importance in
the Homeric world; Athens is mentioned, but not with any prominence;
Corinth is merely a dependency of its neighbour Mycen&aelig;; Sparta
only ranks along with other towns of Laconia; Delphi and Olympia
have not yet assumed anything like the place which they afterwards
occupy as religious centres during the historic period. The chief
cities of Hellas are <a name="page_22"><span class="page">Page
22</span></a> Mycen&aelig;, Tiryns, and Orchomenos. Crete, although
its chiefs, Idomeneus and Meriones, are only of secondary rank among
the heroes of the Iliad, is obviously one of the most important
of Grecian lands. It sends eighty ships to the Ach&aelig;an fleet
at Troy, it is described both in the Iliad and the Odyssey as being
very populous (a hundred cities, Iliad II.; ninety cities, Odyssey
XIX.), and to its capital, Knossos, alone among Greek cities does
Homer apply the epithet 'great.' All which offers a striking contrast
to the comparative insignificance of the towns of the Argolid in
later Greek history, and to the uninfluential part played by Crete.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The centres of power, then, in the Homeric story are widely different
from those of the historic period. The same divergence from later
realities is manifest when we come to look at the social organization
contemplated in the Iliad and the Odyssey. The Homeric state of
society is, in some respects, rude enough. Piracy, for instance, is
recognized as, if not a laudable, at all events a quite ordinary method
of gaining a livelihood. 'Who are you?' says Nestor to Telemachus.
'Whence do you come? Are you engaged in trade, or do you rove at
adventure as sea-robbers who wander at hazard of their lives, bringing
bane to strangers?' The same question is addressed to Odysseus by
Polyphemus, and was plainly the first thing thought of when a seafaring
stranger was encountered. As among the Highlanders and Borderers of
Scotland, cattle-lifting was looked upon as a perfectly respectable
form of <a name="page_23"><span class="page">Page 23</span></a>
employment, and stolen cattle were considered a quite proper gift
for a prospective bridegroom to offer to his father-in-law. The
power of the strong hand was, in most respects, supreme, and the
rights of a tribe or a city were respected more on account of the
ability of its men to defend them than because of any moral obligation.
'We will sack a town for you,' says Menelaus to Telemachus, as an
inducement to him to settle in Laconia.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Along with this primitive rudeness goes, on the other hand, a strongly
aristocratic constitution of society. The great leaders and chiefs,
the long-haired Ach&aelig;ans, are absolutely separated from the
common people, not in rank only, but to all appearance in race.
They are a superior caste, and of a different breed. Even to their
King their subjection is not much more than nominal, and he has to
be very careful of offending their susceptibilities or wounding
their sense of their own importance, while their treatment of the
commons beneath them is sufficiently disdainful. Though the commons
are summoned sometimes to the Council, their function there is merely
a passive one; they are called to hear what has been determined, and
to approve of it, if they so desire, but in no case have they any
alternative to accepting it, even should they disapprove. Altogether
the superiority of the Ach&aelig;an nobles, and the haughtiness with
which they bear themselves, is such as to suggest that they hold
the position, not of tribal chieftains ruling over clansmen of the
same stock as themselves, but of a separate <a name="page_24"><span
class="page">Page 24</span></a> and conquering race holding dominion
over, and using the services of, the vanquished, much after the
manner of the Norman lordship in Sicily.
</p>

<p class="indent">
All this is sufficiently different from the state of things during
the historic period. It is not an undeveloped condition of the
same society that is in contemplation; it is a totally distinct
social organization. With regard to the position of woman, the
facts are even more remarkable, for if the Homeric picture be a
true one, historic Hellas, instead of representing an advance upon
the prehistoric age, presents a distinct retrogression. In the
Homeric poems woman occupies a position, not only important, but
even comparable in many respects to that held by her in modern
life. She is not secluded from sight and kept in the background, as
in later Hellenic society; on the contrary, she mixes freely with
the other sex in private and in public, and is uniformly depicted
as exercising a very strong, and generally beneficent, influence.
The very names of Andromache, Penelope, Nausicaa, stand as types
of all that is purest and sweetest in womanhood. The fact that a
wife is purchased by bride-gifts does not militate against the
respect in which she is held or the regard which is paid to her
rights. The contrast between this state of affairs and that prevailing
in later Greek society is sufficiently marked to render comment
unnecessary.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But perhaps the most striking feature of the setting of the Homeric
story is the type of material civilization which is described in the
poems. We <a name="page_25"><span class="page">Page 25</span></a>
are confronted with a society not by any means in a primitive stage
of development, but, on the contrary, far advanced in the arts
of peace, and capable of the highest achievements in art and
architecture. Some of the proofs of its advancement may be briefly
noticed. Into the vexed question of the Homeric palace, its form,
and the conditions of life thereby indicated, there is no need to
enter; for about the point which chiefly concerns our immediate
purpose there is no question at all. The Homeric palace, described
at some length in at least three instances, is a building not merely
large and commodious, but of somewhat imposing magnificence. The
palace of Alcinous, for example, is pictured for us as gleaming
with the splendour of the sun and moon, with walls of bronze, a
frieze of <i>kuanos</i> (blue glass paste), and golden doors, with
lintels and door-posts of silver, while the approaches to it are
guarded by dogs wrought in silver. The whole reminds one rather of
the description of one of the vast Egyptian temples of the Eighteenth
or Nineteenth Dynasty than of what one would have imagined the
palace of an island chieftain. The Palaces of Priam at Troy, and
of Odysseus at Ithaca, less gorgeously adorned in detail, are not
less stately, and even the abode of Menelaus in comparatively
insignificant Sparta is described as 'gleaming with gold, amber,
silver, and ivory.' The minor appointments of these splendid homes
are in keeping with their structural magnificence. Great vessels
of gold, silver, and bronze are in common use, the richly dyed
and wrought robes <a name="page_26"><span class="page">Page
26</span></a> of the chiefs and their wives and daughters are stored
in chests splendidly decorated and inlaid, and the adornments of
the women are of costly and beautiful fabric in gold and silver.
In the manners and customs of the inhabitants of these stately
houses there is a certain patriarchal simplicity. The Princess
Nausicaa, daughter of King Alcinous, conducts the family washing as
a regular and expected part of her work, while the great chieftains
themselves are men of their hands not only on the battle-field,
but in the common labours of peace. Odysseus is a capable plough
man, carpenter, and shipwright, as well as a good soldier. But
the simplicity is by no means rudeness; it consists with a highly
developed code of manners, and even a considerable refinement.
Brutes like Penelope's suitors may, in half-drunken anger, fling
the furniture or an ox-hoof at the object of their scorn; but there
are brutes in every society, and the manners of the Ach&aelig;ans
in general are stately and dignified.
</p>

<p class="indent">
On the field of war there is still evidence of an advanced stage
of civilization. The whole question of the equipment of the Homeric
heroes has been the subject of perhaps even more dispute than that
of the Homeric house. Infinite pains have been spent in the effort
to show, on the one hand, that the equipment worn by the heroes
of the Iliad was of the more ancient type, consisting mainly of
a great shield of ox-hide large enough to cover the whole body,
behind which the warrior crouched, wearing for defensive armour
no more than a linen <a name="page_27"><span class="page">Page
27</span></a> corselet and leathern cap and gaiters, and on the
other that the hero wore practically the complete panoply of the
later Hellenic hoplite, the small round shield, the bronze helmet,
with metal cuirass, belt, and greaves; while the question of whether
the offensive weapons were of iron or of bronze has been debated
with equal pertinacity. The discussion of such details is beyond
our purpose, and it is sufficient to say that the poems seem to
contemplate both forms of defensive equipment, the old form of
large shield and light body armour, and the later form of small
shield and metal panoply, as being in common use, while on the
question of iron versus bronze, the evidence seems to indicate
that the age contemplated by the bulk of the references is, in the
main, a bronze-using one, though the knowledge of the superiority
of iron is beginning to make itself evident.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But the point which is of importance for our present purpose is the
magnificence with which the arms of the Hellenic heroes, when of
metal, are wrought and decorated. The polished helmets, with their
horse-hair plumes of various colours, the in-wrought breastplates,
and the greaves with their silver fastenings, are not only weapons,
but works of art as well. The supreme instance is, of course, the
armour of Achilles, fabricated, according to the poet, by the hands
of Heph&aelig;stos, but none the less to be regarded as the ideal
of what the highly wrought armour of the time should be. The shield
of Achilles, with its gorgeous representations of various <a
name="page_28"><span class="page">Page 28</span></a> scenes of
peace and war, seems almost to transcend the possibilities of actual
metal work at such a period; yet we may believe that the poet was
not merely drawing upon his imagination, but giving a heightened
picture of what he had himself witnessed in the way of the armourer's
art. Chiefly to be noticed with regard to it is the way in which
he describes the method used by Heph&aelig;stos in producing his
effects&mdash;the inlaying of various metals to get the colours
desired, for instance, in the vineyard scene with its dangling
clusters of purple grapes, its poles, and ditch, and fence. Would
any poet have imagined this had he been entirely unacquainted with
similar products of the armourer's art? As we shall see, it is
precisely this use of the inlaying of metal with metal, to represent
the different colours of the various figures involved, which is
characteristic of the skilled armourer's work in the Mycen&aelig;an
period.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Such, then, are a few of the outstanding features of the state
of society described for us in the Homeric poems. We are brought
by them face to face with a civilization which has very distinct
and pronounced characteristics of its own. It is certainly not the
civilization of the earliest historic period of Greece; political
organization, the relative importance of states and cities, social
life, art and warfare&mdash;all are different from anything we
find in the Hellas of history; in many respects this world of the
poems is at a higher stage of development than that which succeeded
it; but certainly it is <a name="page_29"><span class="page">Page
29</span></a> different. Now, the question of importance for us
is&mdash;Had this poetic world of the Iliad and Odyssey any basis
in fact, or was it merely the creation of the poet or poets who
were responsible for the tales of Ilium and of Odysseus? Were they
describing things which they had seen, or of which the tradition
at least had been handed down to them by those who had seen them,
or were they telling of things which never had any existence save
in their own minds?
</p>

<p class="indent">
This question, of course, is plainly quite distinct from that of
whether the tales they tell are history or romance. The stories of
the flight of Helen, of the siege of Troy, the anger of Achilles,
the valour of Hector, and the love of Andromache, of the wanderings
of much-enduring Odysseus, and the trials of his faithful wife,
Penelope, may be fact, or they may be fiction, or, more probably
perhaps than either, they may be fact largely mingled with fiction;
but that is not the point. It is the medium in which these stories
are set, the background of human life and society upon which they
are projected. Here is a world, astonishingly real in appearance,
and, if real, supremely interesting to us, as representing what the
subsequent ages knew or had heard by tradition of the earliest phases
of the greatest European civilization. Can we trust the picture, or
must we believe it to be but a dream of a state of things which
never really existed? It is, to say the least of it, extremely
hard to believe that the Homeric world is entirely the product of
the <a name="page_30"><span class="page">Page 30</span></a> poetic
imagination. Imagination can work wonders, but it requires to have
a certain amount of material in fact to start upon in its workings.
If it creates a world entirely out of its own consciousness, that
world may be one of extreme beauty and splendour, but it is most
unlikely that it will present any verisimilitude to actual life. It
will be either vague and shadowy, or else so grandiose and unearthly
in its magnificence as to have no point of connection with ordinary
terrestrial life. But it is exactly here that the realism of the
Homeric world strikes the student. It is not vague&mdash;on the
contrary, the preciseness of its detail is almost as striking,
sometimes almost as prosaic, as the detail which makes Robinson
Crusoe the most realistic of all works of fiction; and while its
splendours are such as we look for in vain in early historic Greece,
and are certainly not borrowed from the great civilizations of
Mesopotamia or the Nile Valley, they are such as we can perfectly
well believe to have existed, and such as can be perfectly well
paralleled, though in widely different styles, by Babylonia or
by Thebes.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Was it not more likely that a picture so precise in its outlines,
and so coherent, so thinkable and possible even in its most gorgeous
details, should have had behind it something, probably a great
deal, of fact actually seen and known, than that it should have
been the mere mirage of a poet's dream? 'The picture presented
to us of the Homeric heroes and their surroundings,' says Father
Browne, 'is not merely vivid and complete; it is grand, though
<a name="page_31"><span class="page">Page 31</span></a> with a
grandeur which is homely and simple. Hence the fascination which
we find in the subject of the poems as distinct from the poems
themselves. It may be that this effect is due to the art of the
bards, which well knew how to efface itself in order to ravish
the listener the more. But allowing much to the power of art, the
mind was not yet satisfied. We have said the poems seemed to carry
with them their own evidence that they were not undiluted fiction,
but contained at least an element of objective, perhaps traditional,
truth. It was a beautiful world they told of, and yet it was a world
apart. Agamemnon in the field and Achilles in his tent; Priam in
his palace; Odysseus in his travels; Alcinous with his retainers,
and Arete with her daughter; Penelope and Telemachus in the midst of
the wicked suitors, and the old swineherd and the faithful nurse;
the very shades of the Dead beyond the streams of Oceanus&mdash;how
could the bards describe all these wonders if they had not lived
in a world of their own, or at least acquired the knowledge of it
from their immediate predecessors? The gorgeous palaces of the
Kings, with their walls of bronze, their gold and silver ewers
and basins, and their carven bedsteads and chairs of state and
footstools; and all the glittering raiment and the golden-studded
sceptres, and golden-hilted swords, and silvern ankle-bands, and the
ivory and amber and inlaid metal-work, and the iron-axled chariots
with eight spokes to the wheel, and the crimson-cheeked ships and the
fair-cheeked maidens, and <a name="page_32"><span class="page">Page
32</span></a> the stateliness and grace amid the splendour of it
all&mdash;why should we obstinately refuse to believe that these
bards knew more than we&mdash;that they had seen the vision with
their mortal eye before they took the brush in hand to paint the
picture?[*]
</p>

<p class="footnote">

<p class="indent">
Two lines of evidence, then, if given their fair weight, seemed
to point in the same direction. On the one hand, there were the
legends of a prehistoric age of heroes, with their travels and
expeditions and wars, legends with which Greek literature teemed,
and which, however inextricably blended with fancy, and with details
obviously monstrous and impossible, can scarcely be supposed to
have sprung into being without something behind them to account
for their existence. On the other hand, there was this strange,
wonderful, realistic world of the Homeric poems, no longer existing,
it is true, even at the earliest stage of Greek history, but almost
absolutely refusing to be dismissed as a mere figment of the
imagination. Was it, then, impossible to believe that in the bosom
of the great gulf which separated the Hellas of legend from the
Hellas of history there lay a civilization, real, and once living,
of which the legends and the Homeric pictures preserved but the
scanty surviving ruins and relics?

<p class="indent">
Here we have to recall two facts of importance. First, that universal
Greek tradition affirmed that before the birth of historic Greece
there lay a Dark Age, its darkness caused by the descent from the
<a name="page_33"><span class="page">Page 33</span></a> North of
the rude, iron-using Dorian tribes, who found in the lands which
they invaded a civilization of the Bronze Age, far more advanced
than their own, and, by the help of their superior weapons, conquered
and indeed destroyed it. And second, that even in the gorgeous
picture given by the Homeric poems of the period with which they
deal, there is a constant tendency to regard that period as being
only the decadent and inferior heir of a civilization which had
preceded it. Nothing is plainer in Homer than the suggestion that
the men of the age before the Trojan Wars were greater, stronger,
wiser, better in every respect than even the heroes who fought on
'the ringing plains of windy Troy,' even as these were greater
than the men of the poet's own degenerate days. Does it not seem
as though we were being led towards the conclusion that the Homeric
civilization is itself the representation of a very real fact of
history, the picture of a state of things which was submerged and
swept away by the coming of the Dorians, or by whatever inrush of
wild northern tribes the Greeks may have called by that general title,
but which was itself only the last decadent stage of an antecedent
culture, still greater and more highly developed&mdash;that of
the legendary period? The answer to this question has come in the
most surprising and romantic fashion from the arch&aelig;ological
discoveries of the last forty years.

CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="subtitle">SCHLIEMANN AND HIS WORK</p>

<p class="indent">
The man whose labours were to give a new impetus to the study of
Greek origins, and to be the beginning of the revelation of an
unknown world of ancient days, was born on January 6, 1822, at
Neu Buckow in Mecklenburg-Schwerin. He was the son of a clergyman
who himself had a deep love for the great tales of antiquity, for
his son has told how his father used often vividly to narrate the
stories of the destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum, and of the
Trojan War. When Schliemann was barely seven years old he received
a present of a child's history of the world, in which the picture of
the destruction of Troy and the flight of &AElig;neas made a profound
impression upon his young mind, and roused in him a passionate desire
to go and see for himself what remained of the ancient splendours
of Ilium. He found it impossible to believe that the massive
fortifications of Troy had vanished without leaving a trace of
their existence. When his father admitted that the walls were once
as huge as those depicted in his history book, but asserted that
they <a name="page_35"><span class="page">Page 35</span></a> were
now totally destroyed, he retorted: 'Father, if such walls once
existed, they cannot possibly have been completely destroyed; vast
ruins of them must still remain, but they are hidden beneath the
dust of ages.' Already he had made the resolution that some day
he would excavate Troy.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The romance of bygone days and of hidden treasure surrounded the
boy's early years, and no doubt had its own influence in determining
his bent. A pond just behind his father's garden had its legend of
a maiden who rose from its waters each midnight, bearing a silver
bowl. In the village an ancient barrow had its story of a robber
knight who had buried his favourite child there in a golden cradle;
and near by was the old castle of Henning von Holstein, who, when
besieged by the Duke of Mecklenburg, had buried his treasures close
to the keep of his stronghold. On such romantic legends Schliemann's
young imagination was nourished. By the time he was ten years old
he had produced a Latin essay on the Trojan War. Such things, which
in another might have been mere childish precocities, were in him
the indications of an enthusiasm for antiquity, which was destined
to be the ruling passion of his whole life.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Yet the beginnings of his career in the world were unromantic to
the last degree. His father's poverty forced him to give up the hope
of a learned life, and at the age of fourteen he was apprenticed
to a small grocer in a country village, in whose employment, surely
uncongenial enough for such a <a name="page_36"><span class="page">Page
36</span></a> spirit, he spent five and a half years, selling butter,
herrings, potato-brandy and the like, and occupying his spare moments
in tidying out the little shop. Even in such circumstances his
passion for the Homeric story found means, sufficiently quaint, for
its gratification. There came one evening to the shop a miller's man,
who had been well educated, but had fallen into poor circumstances,
and had taken to drink, yet even in his degradation had not forgotten
his Homer. 'That evening,' says Schliemann, 'he recited to us about
a hundred lines of the poet, observing the rhythmic cadence of the
verses. Although I did not understand a syllable, the melodious
sound of the words made a deep impression upon me, and I wept bitter
tears over my unhappy fate. Three times over did I get him to repeat
to me those divine verses, rewarding his trouble with three glasses
of whisky, which I bought with the few pence that made up my whole
wealth. From that moment I never ceased to pray God that by His
grace I might yet have the happiness of learning Greek.'
</p>

<p class="indent">
To one whose heart was filled with such a passion for learning, no
obstacle could prove insuperable. Yet for many a day the Fates seemed
most unpropitious. Ill-health drove him to emigrate to Venezuela,
but his ship was wrecked on the Dutch coast, and he became the
errand-boy of a business house in Amsterdam. Here in his first
year of service he managed, while going on his master's errands, to
learn English in the first six months and <a name="page_37"><span
class="page">Page 37</span></a> French in the next, and incidentally
to save for intellectual purposes one half of his salary of 800
francs. The mental training of the first year enabled him to learn
Dutch, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese with much greater rapidity,
each language being acquired in six weeks. In 1846 he was sent by
another firm as their agent to St. Petersburg, where in the next
year he founded a business house of his own, and from that time
all went well with him. The Crimean War brought him opportunities
which he utilized with such ingenuity as to derive considerable
profit from them. By 1858 he considered that the fortune he had
made was sufficient to warrant him in devoting himself entirely
to arch&aelig;ology, and though exceptional circumstances obliged
him to return to business for a little, he finally cut himself
loose from it in 1863, and took up the task which was to occupy
the remainder of his busy life.

<p class="indent">
His Greek studies had led him to two convictions on which his whole
exploring work was based. First, that the site of ancient Troy
was on the spot called in classical days New Ilium, the Hill of
Hissarlik, near the coast of the &AElig;gean; and second, that the
Greek traveller, Pausanias, was right in stating that the murdered
Agamemnon and his kin were buried within the walls of the Acropolis
at Mycen&aelig;, and not without it. In both these opinions he
ran counter to the prevailing views of his time. It was generally
believed that, if Troy had ever any real existence at all, its site
was to be looked for not <a name="page_38"><span class="page">Page
38</span></a> at Hissarlik, but far inland near Bunarbashi; while
the authority of Pausanias as to the graves of the Atreid&aelig;
was held to be quite unreliable.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Schliemann resolved to put his convictions to the test of actual
excavation. In April, 1870, he cut the first sod of his excavation
at Hissarlik. The work went on with varying, but never brilliant,
fortune, until the year 1873, when his faith and constancy began
at last to meet with their reward. On the south-west of the site
a great city gate was uncovered, lines of wall, already partly
disclosed, began to show themselves more plainly, and quite close
to the gate there was discovered the famous 'Treasure of Priam,'
so called, a considerable mass of vessels and ornaments in gold
and silver, with a number of spearheads, axes, daggers, and cups,
wrought in copper. As the excavations progressed, it became evident
that not one city, but many cities, had stood upon this ancient
site. The First City, reached, of course, at the lowest level of
the excavation, immediately above the virgin soil, belonged to a
very early stage of human development. Its remains yielded such
objects as stone axes and flint knives, together with the black,
hand-made, polished pottery, known as 'bucchero,' which is
characteristic of Neolithic sites in the &AElig;gean, ornamented
frequently with incised patterns which are filled in with a white
chalky substance. The stratum of d&eacute;bris belonging to the
First City averages about 8 feet in depth.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Above this lay a layer of soil about 1 foot 9 inches <a
name="page_39"><span class="page">Page 39</span></a> in depth, and
then, on the top of a great layer of d&eacute;bris, by which the
site had been levelled and extended, came the walls of the Second
City. Here were the remains of a fortified gate with a ramp, paved
with stone, leading up to it (<a href="#plate_II">Plate II. 1</a>),
and a strong wall of sun-dried brick resting upon a scarped stone
substructure. This, with its projecting towers, had evidently once
formed the enclosure of an Acropolis; and within the wall lay the
remains of a large building which appeared to have been a house or
palace. The separate finds included the great treasure already
mentioned, and numerous other articles of use and adornment, golden
hair-pins, bracelets, ear-pendants, a very primitive leaden idol of
female form, and abundance of pottery, of which some specimens belong
to the class of vases with long spouts, known to arch&aelig;ologists
as 'Schnabelkanne,' or 'beak-jugs.' Above the stratum of the Second
City lay the remains of no fewer than seven other settlements,
more or less clearly marked, ending at the uppermost layer with
the ruins of Roman Ilium, and its marble temple of Athena.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The gate and walls of the Second City&mdash;the fact that it had
been undoubtedly destroyed by fire, and the evidence of wealth
and artistic faculty offered by the golden treasure&mdash;seemed
to Dr. Schliemann decisive evidence of the fact that this had been
the Ilion of the Homeric poems. The treasure was named 'Priam's
Treasure,' the largest building, 'Priam's Palace,' and the gate,
'The Sc&aelig;an Gate.' <a name="page_40"><span class="page">Page
40</span></a> It quickly became apparent, however, that the Second
City could not claim Homeric honours, but must be of yet more venerable
antiquity. The style, alike of the city buildings and of the articles
found, was much too primitive for the Homeric period, and pointed
to a date much earlier&mdash;probably, indeed, about a thousand
years earlier than that of the Trojan War. The great treasure,
whose workmanship seemed to militate against this conclusion, was
suspected to have somehow slipped down during the excavations from
the level of the Sixth City to that of the Second, as it seemed
impossible that such fine work could belong to the very early period
of the Burnt City; but subsequent discoveries, particularly those
of Mr. Seager on the little island of Mokhlos, off the coast of
Crete, have paralleled the splendour of the Trojan treasure with
work which is undoubtedly of the same early date as the Second
City, so that Schliemann's accuracy has been confirmed in this
instance. The citadel itself seemed far too small to fill the place
which Troy occupies in Homer's description, even allowing for poetic
exaggeration. In 1890, the year of his death, Schliemann was on the
way to the solution of the problem, and in 1892, his coadjutor,
Professor D&ouml;rpfeld, finally proved that the Sixth City, lying
four strata above Schliemann's Troy, was the true Ilion of the
great epic. Its wider circuit had been missed by Schliemann in his
earlier excavations owing to the fact that, at the centre of the
site where he was working, the d&eacute;bris had been planed and
<a name="page_41"><span class="page">Page 41</span></a> levelled
away by the Romans to make room for the buildings of their New
Ilium. The pottery of the Sixth City was of the type which in the
meantime had come to be called Mycen&aelig;an, from the discoveries
in the plain of Argos, and its massive circuit wall, enclosing
an area two and a half times greater than that of the Second
City, is quite worthy of the fame of Homeric Troy. Without much
risk of mistake, we may conclude that we have before us in
<a href="#plate_III">Plate III</a>. the actual wall from whose
summit Andromache beheld the corpse of the gallant Hector dragged
behind the chariot of his relentless foe. The mere fact of his
having to some extent misinterpreted the evidence of his discoveries
can scarcely be said, however, to take anything from the credit
justly due to Schliemann. Had he been spared for but a year or two
longer he could not have failed to complete his work, and to prove,
as his fellow-worker did, that on the site which he had from the
first contended to be that of Troy, there had stood a large and
splendidly built city, which assuredly belongs to the period of
the Trojan War.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The work at Troy, however, had not gone on uninterruptedly between
1870 and Schliemann's death in 1890, and the discoveries which
occupied some of the intervening years were of even greater scientific
importance, though the glamour of romance attaching to the name
of Troy drew perhaps more attention to the work there. A dispute
with the Turkish Government over the disposal of 'Priam's Treasure'
led to obstacles being placed by the <a name="page_42"><span
class="page">Page 42</span></a> Porte in the way of the resumption
of work on the plain of Troy, and in July, 1876, he settled down to
excavate at Mycen&aelig;, the historic capital of the King of men,
Agamemnon, with a view to the proving of his second theory&mdash;the
burial of the Atreid&aelig; within the Acropolis of Mycen&aelig;.
The ancient citadel of Agamemnon stands in the plain of Argos,
on an isolated hill 912 feet in height. Before Schliemann turned
his attention to it, it was already well known to students of
arch&aelig;ology from the remains of its walls, and particularly
from the splendid Lion Gate (<a href="#plate_IV">Plate IV.</a>) with
its famous relief of the sacred pillar supported by two colossal
lions, and from the great beehive tombs of the lower city&mdash;the
so-called 'Treasuries.' But the chief thing which drew the explorer
to Mycen&aelig; was not these remains; it was the statement of
Pausanias already referred to. 'Some remains of the circuit wall,'
says Pausanias, 'are still to be seen, and the gate which has lions
over it. These were built, they say, by the Cyclopes, who made the
wall at Tiryns for Proitos. Among the ruins at Mycen&aelig; is the
fountain called Perseia, and some subterranean buildings belonging
to Atreus and his children, where their treasures were kept. There
is the tomb of Atreus, and of those whom Aigisthos slew at the banquet,
on their return from Ilion with Agamemnon.... There is also the tomb
of Agamemnon, and that of Eurymedon the charioteer, and the joint tomb
of Teledamos and Pelops, the twin children of Kassandra, whom Aigisthos
slew <a name="page_43"><span class="page">Page 43</span></a> with their
parents while still mere babes.... Klytemnestra and Aigisthos were
buried a little way outside the walls, for they were not thought
worthy to be within, where Agamemnon lay and those who fell with him.'
</p>

<p class="indent">
Persuaded in his own mind of the truth of this statement, Schliemann,
while clearing the Lion Gate, and investigating the already rifted
tomb known as the Treasury of Atreus, caused a great pit, 113 feet
square, to be dug within the walls at a distance of about 40 feet
from the Lion Gate. With the most extraordinary good fortune he
had hit upon the exact spot which he sought, and had even almost
exactly proportioned his pit to the area within which the treasures
lay. After only a few days' digging, slabs of stone, vertically
placed, began to come to light, and before long a complete double
ring of stone slabs, 87 feet in diameter, was disclosed
(<a href="#plate_II">Plate II. 2</a>). Schliemann's first idea was
that he had discovered the Agora of Mycen&aelig;, the 'well-polished
circle of stones' on which the elders of the city sat for councilor
judgment, as Heph&aelig;stos depicted them on the shield of Achilles;
but even this discovery did not satisfy him; he was resolved to go
down to virgin soil or rock, and his perseverance was rewarded.
</p>

<p class="indent">
First there came into view a circular altar, and several steles of
soft stone with rude carvings in relief, which seemed to point to
interments beneath, and a system of offerings to, or on behalf of, the
dead. Three feet below the altar, and 23 feet <a name="page_44"><span
class="page">Page 44</span></a> below the surface level, there
came to light the top of the first of a group of five rock-hewn
graves. The graves were rectangular, varied in depth from 10 to
16 feet, and ranged in size from 9 by 10 feet to 16 by 22 feet.
They had been carefully lined with a wall of small quarry-stones
and clay, and roofed over with slate slabs; but the roofing had
broken down, owing to the decay of the beams which supported it,
and the graves were filled with earth and pebbles. Mingled with
the d&eacute;bris brought down by the collapse of the roofs lay
human bodies, one in the smallest grave, five in the largest, and
three in each of the others; and along with them had been buried
one of the most remarkable hoards of treasure that ever greeted
the eye of a discoverer.

Gold was there in profusion, beaten into masks for the faces of the
dead (perhaps to protect them from the evil eye), into head-bands,
breast-pieces, plaques of all shapes and sizes, and wrought into
bracelets, rings, pins, baldrics, and dagger and sword hilts. Along

diadems, fifteen pendants, eleven neck-coils, eight hair ornaments,
ten gold grasshoppers with gold chains, one butterfly, four griffins,

Schliemann. The mere money-value of the finds amounted to something
like four thousand pounds sterling!
</p>

<p class="indent">
Money-value, however, was nothing in Schliemann's eyes compared
with the thought that he had discovered the actual graves which
Pausanias saw, and in which Agamemnon and his companions were buried
after their tragic end at the hands of Aigisthos and Klytemnestra.
To his eager enthusiasm many of the circumstances of the discovery
seemed to lend probability to such a supposition. The disorder
in which the bodies were found, one with its head crushed down
upon the bosom, the half-shut eye of one of the mute company, and
other indications, seemed to point to such haste in the interment
as might have been expected in the case of a King and his companions
who had met with so tragic a fate. Accordingly, the discoverer
announced in his famous telegram to the King of the Hellenes, and
maintained in his works, that he had found Agamemnon and his household.
For a time this view and his enthusiastic advocacy of it gained
the ear of the public; but gradually it became apparent that the
disorder of the graves and the condition of the corpses was due,
not to hasty interment, but to the collapse of the roofs of the
graves; the grave furniture was shown not to belong by any means
<a name="page_46"><span class="page">Page 46</span></a> entirely to
one period; and the number and sex of the persons interred did not
agree with the legend, or with the account of Pausanias. Admiration
turned to incredulity, and even to undeserved ridicule of the
enthusiastic explorer; but the lapse of time has made critics less
inclined to mock at Schliemann's eager belief, and it is largely
conceded now that while perhaps the tombs may not be actually those
of the great King of the Ach&aelig;ans and his friends, they are
at least those which were long held to be such by tradition, and
which Pausanias intended to denote by his descriptions. In any
case, the question of whether the explorer discovered the body
of one dead King or of another is of entirely minor importance.
To find Agamemnon would have been a romantic exploit thoroughly
in accordance with the bent of Schliemann's mind, and a fitting
crown to a life which in itself was the very romance of exploration.
But Schliemann had done something infinitely more important than
to make the find of a dead King, even though that King had reigned
for more than two and a half millenniums in the greatest poem of
the world; he had begun the resurrection of a dead civilization.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Besides the great discovery of the Shaft-Graves, Schliemann carried
on the exploration of the famous beehive tombs in the lower city of
Mycen&aelig;. One of these, the largest, was already well known by the
name of the 'Treasury of Atreus' (<a href="#plate_V">Plate V. 2</a>).
It consists of a long entrance passage running back into the hillside,
and leading to a great vaulted <a name="page_47"><span class="page">
Page 47</span></a> chamber excavated out of the hill, and shaped like
a beehive. The entrance passage is 20 feet broad and 115 feet long,
and is lined on either side with walls of massive masonry which
increase in height as the hill rises. This passage leads to a vertical
fa&ccedil;ade 46 feet high, pierced by a door between 17 and 18 feet
in height, which was bordered by columns carrying a cornice, above
which was a triangular relieving space, masked by slabs of red porphyry
adorned with spiral decorations, while the whole fa&ccedil;ade appears
to have been enriched with bronze ornaments and coloured marbles.
The massive lintel of the door is 29 feet 6 inches long, 16 feet 6
inches deep, and 3 feet 4 inches high, with a weight of about 120
tons&mdash;a mass of stone fairly comparable with some of the gigantic
blocks in which Egyptian architects delighted. It is, for instance,
about ten tons heavier than the quartzite block which forms the
sepulchral chamber in the pyramid of Amenemhat III. at Hawara. The
great chamber of the tomb consists of an impressive circular vault
48 feet in diameter and in height. Its construction is not that
of true vaulting; but each of the thirty-three courses projects a
little beyond the one below it, until at last they approach closely
at the apex, which is closed by a single slab. The courses, after
being laid, were hewn to a perfectly smooth curve, and carefully
polished, and it appears that the whole of the dome was decorated
with rosettes of bronze, a scheme of adornment which recalls the
bronze walls of the Palace of Alcinous. <a name="page_48"><span
class="page">Page 48</span></a> From the great chamber a side door,
bearing traces of rich decoration, leads to a square room, 27 feet
square by 19 feet high, which may possibly have been the actual
place of interment. Curtius found 'this lofty and solemn vault'
the most imposing of all the monuments of ancient Greece.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In the same hillside as the Treasury of Atreus, but some 400 yards
north of it, stands the tomb known as the 'Tomb of Klytemnestra,' or
'Mrs. Schliemann's Treasury'&mdash;the latter title being due to the
fact that it was partially excavated in 1876 by Dr. Schliemann's wife.
In size it very closely corresponds to the better known tomb, while
its columns of dark green alabaster, its door-lintel of leek-green
marble, and the slabs of red marble which closed the relieving
triangle above the door show that it had been not less magnificent
than its neighbour.

<p class="indent">
Following up his excavations at Mycen&aelig;, Schliemann, in 1880-81,
excavated at Orchomenos in B&oelig;otia the so-called 'Treasury of Minyas,'
discovering in its square side-chamber a beautiful ceiling formed
of slabs of slate sculptured with an exquisite pattern of rosettes
and spirals, which shows very distinct traces of Egyptian artistic
influence (unless, as Mr. H. R. Hall has now come to believe, we
are to trace the origin of the spiral as a decorative motive, not
to Egypt, but to the Minoans of Crete). At Tiryns, Schliemann began
in 1884 another series of excavations which laid bare the whole
ground-plan of the citadel palace of that <a name="page_49"><span
class="page">Page 49</span></a> ancient fortress town with its
halls and separate apartments for men and women, and the colossal
enclosing wall, in some parts 57 feet thick, with its towers and
galleries and chambers constructed in the thickness of the wall
(<a href="#plate_V">Plate V. 1</a>). The palace revealed evidences
of considerable skill in the decorative arts. A beautiful frieze of
alabaster carved in rosettes and palmettes, inlaid with blue paste,
made plain what Homer meant when he wrote of the Palace of Alcinous:
'Brazen were the walls which ran this way and that from the threshold
to the inmost chamber, and round them was a frieze of blue'
(<i>kuanos</i>); while fresco paintings in several of the rooms
exhibited the spiral and rosette decoration of Orchomenos and Egypt.
But perhaps the most interesting find was the remains of a great
wall-painting in which a mighty bull is represented charging at full
speed, while an athlete, clinging to the monster's horn with one hand,
vaults over his back&mdash;a picture which is the first important
example of the now well-known and numerous set of similar
representations which have given us a clue to something of the meaning
of the old legend of the man-destroying Minotaur and his tribute of
human victims.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Schliemann's discoveries, notwithstanding all the incredulity aroused
by his sometimes rather headlong enthusiasm, created an extraordinary
amount of interest among scholars and students of early European
culture. It was felt at once that he had brought the world face
to face with facts which <a name="page_50"><span class="page">Page
50</span></a> must profoundly modify all opinions hitherto held as
to the origins of Greek civilization; for the advanced and fully
ripened art which was disclosed, especially in the wonderful finds
from the Shaft- or Circle-Graves, stood on an entirely different
plane from any art which had hitherto been associated with the
early age of Greece; and it was evident, not only that the date at
which civilization began to reveal itself in Hellas must be pushed
back several centuries, but also that the great differences between
the mature Mycen&aelig;an art and the infant art of Greece required
explanation. To the discoverer himself, the supreme interest of his
finds always lay in the thought that they were the direct prototypes,
if not the actual originals, of the civilization described in the
Homeric poems; but to the question whether this was so or not, a
question interesting in itself, but largely academic, there succeeded
a much more important one. Here was proof of the existence of a
civilization, obviously great and long-enduring, whose products
could not be identified with those of any other art known to exist.
To what race of men were the achievements of this early culture
to be ascribed, and what relation did they hold to the Hellenes
of history?
</p>

<p class="indent">
The work of Schliemann was continued and extended by successors
such as D&ouml;rpfeld, Tsountas, Mackenzie, and others, and by
the end of the nineteenth century it had become apparent that the
culture of which the first important traces had been found at
Mycen&aelig; had extended to some extent over <a name="page_51"><span
class="page">Page 51</span></a> all Hellas, but chiefly over the
south-eastern portion of the mainland and over the Cyclades. The
principal find-spots in Greece proper were in the Argolid and in
Attica; but, besides these, abundant material was discovered at
Enkomi (Cyprus) and at Phyl&acirc;kopi (Melos), while from Vaphio,
near Amykl&aelig; in Laconia, there came, among other treasures,
a pair of most wonderful gold cups, whose workmanship surpassed
anything that could have been imagined of such an early period,
and is only to be matched by the goldsmith work of the Renaissance.
Hissarlik, under Dr. D&ouml;rpfeld's hands, yielded from the Sixth
City the evidence of an Asiatic civilization truly contemporaneous
with that of Mycen&aelig;. Even before the end of the century it
became apparent that Crete was destined to prove a focus of this
early culture, and the promise, as we shall see later, has been
more than fulfilled. In Egypt Professor Petrie found deposits of
prehistoric &AElig;gean pottery in the Delta, the Fayum, and even in
Middle Egypt, proving that this civilization, whatever its origin,
had been in contact with the ancient civilization of the Nile Valley,
while even in the Western Mediterranean, in Sicily particularly,
in Italy, Sardinia, and Spain, finds, less plentiful, but quite
unmistakable, bore witness to the wide diffusion of Mycen&aelig;an
culture.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Roughly, the result came to this: 'that before the epoch at which
we are used to place the beginnings of Greek civilization&mdash;that
is, the opening centuries of the last millennial period B.C.&mdash;we
must allow for <a name="page_52"><span class="page">Page 52</span></a>
an immensely long record of human artistic productivity, going
back into the Neolithic Age, and culminating towards the close of
the age of Bronze in a culture more fecund and more refined than
any we are to find again in the same lands till the age of Iron
was far advanced. Man in Hellas was more highly civilized before
history than when history begins to record his state; and there
existed human society in the Hellenic area, organized and productive,
to a period so remote that its origins were more distant from the
age of Pericles than that age is from our own. We have probably to
deal with a total period of civilization in the &AElig;gean not
much shorter than in the Nile Valley.[*]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote *: Hogarth, 'Authority and Arch&aelig;ology,' p. 230.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The estimate in Hogarth's last sentence, which was published in
1899, before Evans's great discoveries in Crete, was one that must
have seemed extravagant to those who, while familiar with the great
antiquity of Mesopotamian and Egyptian culture, had been accustomed
to think of Greek civilization as having its beginning not so very
long before the First Olympiad. It has been fully justified, however,
by the event, and it may now be accepted as an established fact that
the earliest civilization of Greece meets the two great ancient
civilizations of Babylon and Egypt on substantially equal terms.
In antiquity it appears to be practically contemporary with them;
in artistic merit it need not shrink from comparison with either
of them.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In the earlier stages of the discussion which <a name="page_53"><span
class="page">Page 53</span></a> followed on the discoveries, it was
assumed, perhaps somewhat hastily, that such a culture could not
have been indigenous, resemblances to Egyptian and Mesopotamian
work were pointed out, and it was suggested that the impulse and the
skill which gave rise to the art of Mycen&aelig; were not native
but borrowed, the Ph&oelig;nicians being generally held to be the
medium through which the influence of the East had filtered into the
&AElig;gean area. As time has gone on, however, the Ph&oelig;nicians
have gradually come to bulk less and less in the view of students of
the &AElig;gean problem. It is no longer held that they contributed
anything original to the development of Mycen&aelig;an culture, and
even as middlemen the tendency is to allow them an influence far
smaller than was once held to be theirs. It has become manifest
that, in at least the case of Crete and Egypt, communication need
not have been through Ph&oelig;nician media at all, but was far more
probably direct. And with regard to the whole question of the debt
owed to the East by this early European civilization, it is probable
that the &AElig;gean gave quite as much as it borrowed, and that
its artists were sufficiently great to have originated their own
culture. Mycen&aelig;an, and still more the great Minoan art of
which Mycen&aelig;an has proved to be only a decadent phase, needed
no Oriental crutches. With regard to Egypt, the obligations of the
two cultures were certainly mutual; each influenced the other;
it was not a case of master and scholar, but of two contemporary
civilizations, each fully inspired <a name="page_54"><span
class="page">Page 54</span></a> with a native spirit, each ready
to use whatever seemed good to it in the work of the other, but
both perfectly original in their genius.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The question which was of such supreme interest to Schliemann still
survives, however, though in a wider and more important form than
that in which he conceived of it. It is no longer a question of
whether the graves which he found were actually those of Agamemnon
and his fellow-victims in the dark tragedy of Mycen&aelig;, but of
whether the people and the civilization whose remains have been
brought to light are, or are not, the people and the civilization
from which the Homeric bards drew the whole setting of their poems.
Were the Mycen&aelig;ans the Greeks of the Iliad and the Odyssey,
and was it their culture that is depicted for us in these great
poems?
</p>

<p class="indent">
The arguments in favour of such a supposition are of considerable
strength. For one thing, we have the remarkable coincidence between
the geography of the poems and the localities over which the
Mycen&aelig;an culture is seen to have extended. The towns and lands
which occupy the foremost place in the Homeric story are also those
in which the most convincing evidences of Mycen&aelig;an culture have
been discovered. Foremost, of course, we have Mycen&aelig; itself.
To Homer, 'golden,' 'broad-wayed' Mycen&aelig; is the seat of the
great leader of all the Ach&aelig;ans, the King of men, Agamemnon;
it is also the chief seat of the culture which goes by its name.
Orchomenos, Pylos, Laced&aelig;mon, Attica, all prominent in the
poems, are <a name="page_55"><span class="page">Page 55</span></a>
also well-known seats of Mycen&aelig;an civilization. Crete, whose
prominent position in the Homeric world has been already referred
to, we shall shortly see to have been in point of fact the supreme
centre of that still greater and richer civilization of which the
Mycen&aelig;an is a later and comparatively degenerate form. There
is no need to enter into further detail; but broadly it is the
fact that the distribution of Mycen&aelig;an remains practically
follows, at least to a great extent, the geography of the poems.
The world with which the Homeric bards were familiar was, in the
main, the world in which the civilization of the Mycen&aelig;ans
prevailed.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The Homeric house also finds a striking parallel in the details
of the Mycen&aelig;an palaces whose remains have been preserved.
Leaving aside all disputed points, the broad fact remains that
'all the structural features described, the courtyard, with its
altar to Zeus and trench for sacrifices; the vestibule; the
ante-chamber; the hall, with its fireplace and its pillars; the
bathroom, with passage from the hall; the upper story, sometimes
containing the women's quarters; the spaciousness; the decoration;
even the furniture, have been most wonderfully identified at Tiryns
and Mycen&aelig;, and in Crete.' In Crete, along with the resemblances
above referred to, are found important differences, such as the
position of the hearth, and the details of the lighting. These,
which are probably due to differences of climate, do not, however,
invalidate the fact of the general correspondence.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_56"><span class="page">Page 56</span></a> In details,
we have the frieze of <i>kuanos</i> of the Palace of Alcinous,
paralleled by the fragments discovered, as already mentioned, at
Tiryns, and by similar friezes at Knossos, while the bronze walls
of the same palace have been, if not paralleled, at all events
illustrated, by the bronze decorations of the vaults of the great
bee-hive tombs at Mycen&aelig; and Orchomenos. The parallel is,
perhaps, even closer when we come to the details of metal-working,
which are described for us in Homer, and of which illustrations have
been found in such profusion among the Mycen&aelig;an relics. We are
told, for example, that on the brooch of Odysseus was represented a
hound holding a writhing fawn between its forepaws, and we have the
elaborate workmanship of the cup of Nestor&mdash;'a right goodly
cup, that the old man brought from home, embossed with studs of
gold, and four handles there were to it, and round each two golden
doves were feeding, and to the cup were two bottoms. Another man
could scarce have lifted the cup from the table, but Nestor the Old
raised it easily.' The Mycen&aelig;an finds have yielded examples
of metal-working which seem to come as near to the Homeric pictures
as it is possible for material things to come to verbal descriptions.
One of the golden cups from the Fourth Grave at Mycen&aelig; might
almost have been a copy on a small scale of Nestor's cup, save
that it had only two handles instead of four. On the handles, as
in the Homeric picture, doves are feeding, and like Nestor's, the
Mycen&aelig;an cup is riveted with gold.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_57"><span class="page">Page 57</span></a> Or, take
again such examples of another form of art-work in metal as are
given by the scenes of the lion hunt and the hunting-cats on the
dagger-blades found in Graves IV. and V. at Mycen&aelig;. In the first
of these scenes we have a representation of five men attacking three
lions. The foremost man has been thrown down by the assault of the
first lion, and is entangled in his great shield. His four companions
are coming to his help, one armed with a bow, the others carrying
spears and huge shields, two of them of the typical Mycen&aelig;an
figure-eight shape. Only the first lion awaits their onset, the
other two are in full flight. The whole work is characterized by
extraordinary vivacity; but it is the technique that is of interest.
The picture is made up out of various metals inlaid on a thin bronze
plate, which is let into the dagger-blade. The lions and the bare
skin of the men are inlaid in gold, the loin-cloths and the shields
are of silver, all the accessories, such as shield-straps and the
patterns on the loin-cloths, are given in a dark substance, while the
ground is coated with a dark enamel to give relief to the figures.
The hunting-cat scene, which presents remarkable resemblances to a
well-known scene from a wall-painting at Thebes, represents cats
hunting wild-fowl in a marsh intersected by a winding river, in
which fish are swimming and papyrus plants growing. 'The cats, the
plants, and the bodies of the ducks are inlaid with gold, the wings
of the ducks and the river are silver, and the fish are given in some
dark substance. On the <a name="page_58"><span class="page">Page
58</span></a> neck of one of the ducks is a red drop of blood, probably
given by alloyed gold.' Here we have the very type of art in which
the decorations of the shield of Achilles were carried out. 'Also
he set therein a vineyard teeming plenteously with clusters, wrought
fair in gold; black were the grapes, but the vines hung throughout
on silver poles. And around it he ran a ditch of <i>kuanos</i>,
and round that a fence of tin.... Also he wrought therein a herd
of kine with upright horns, and the kine were fashioned of gold
and tin.'
</p>

<p class="indent">
Such are some of the points which countenance the idea that in
the Mycen&aelig;an people we have the originals of the people of
the Homeric poems. On the other hand there are difficulties, by
no means inconsiderable, in the way of such a belief. Of these
the chief is the question of the method in which the bodies of the
dead are disposed of. The men of the Homeric poems burned their
dead; the men of the Mycen&aelig;an civilization buried theirs.
Undoubtedly this is a serious difficulty in the way of identification,
presupposing, as it does, a different view of the destiny of the soul
after death. The men who burned the bodies of their dead believed
that the soul had no further use for its body after death, but
departed into a distant, shadowy, immaterial region, so that the
body, if it had any connection with the soul, acted rather as a
drag and a defilement, from which it was well that the soul should
be released. Therefore they dematerialized the body, and often the
things used by the body <a name="page_59"><span class="page">Page
59</span></a> during life, by the action of fire. On the other
hand, those who buried their dead believed that the spirit of the
dead man dwelt in some fashion in the tomb, or at least hovered
around the body, waiting, perhaps, for a reincarnation, and capable
of using the weapons, the utensils, and the foods of its former
life. Therefore the body was carefully interred, sometimes even
embalmed, and its weapons and foods, or at all events simulacra
of these, were laid beside it.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The distinction between the two lines of thought is clear and strong;
but it does not necessarily presuppose an absolute distinction of
race. It is not improbable that towards the end of the Mycen&aelig;an
period, to which in any case the connection with the Homeric poems
would belong, cremation was beginning to supersede the older practice
of interment. In late Mycen&aelig;an graves at Salamis evidences of
cremation are found, and at Mouliana, in Crete, there are instances
of uncremated bones being found along with bronze swords on one
side of a tomb, while on the other were found an iron sword and
cremated bones in a cinerary urn. The distinction, then, is not
necessarily one of race, but of custom, gradually changing, perhaps
within a comparatively short period. It has even been suggested
that no interval of time of any great extent is needed, as the
practice of cremation may quickly develop among any race, being
prompted by the comfortable idea that when the flesh is disposed
of, the possibly inconvenient, possibly even <a name="page_60"><span
class="page">Page 60</span></a> vampire, ghost of a disagreeable
ancestor goes along with it.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Another difficulty arises from the fact that the Homeric poems
certainly contemplate a much wider use of iron than can be found
among the remains of the Mycen&aelig;an people. But the weight of
this objection may easily be exaggerated. Certainly the equipment
contemplated for the Homeric heroes is in most cases of bronze, though
the well-known line from the Odyssey, 'iron does of itself attract
a man,' bears witness to a time when iron had become the almost
universal fighting metal. But even in some of the Mycen&aelig;an
tombs iron appears in the shape of finger-rings; and in East Cretan
tombs of the latest Minoan period iron swords have been found. And
if, as is generally agreed, the Homeric poems represent the work
of several bards covering a considerable period of time, there is
nothing out of the way in the supposition that, while the earlier
writers represented bronze as the material for weapons, because it
was actually so in their time, the later ones, writing at a period
when iron was largely superseding, but had not altogether superseded,
the older metal, should, while clinging in general to the old poetic
word used by their predecessors, occasionally introduce the name
of the metal which was becoming prevalent in their day. From this
point of view the difficulty seems to disappear. The Homeric age
proper is one of bronze-using people; but, in the later stages of
the development of the poems, iron makes its appearance, just <a
name="page_61"><span class="page">Page 61</span></a> as it had
been gradually doing in the generally bronze-using Mycen&aelig;an
civilization.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The same remark applies to the differences of equipment between
the warriors of the Mycen&aelig;an and those of the Homeric period.
The Mycen&aelig;ans used the great hide-shield, either oblong or
8-shaped, covering its bearer from head to foot, with a leather
cap for the head, and no defensive armour of metal. In the Iliad,
on the other hand, what is obviously contemplated in general is
a metal helmet, a metal cuirass, and a comparatively small round
shield. But, again, in later Mycen&aelig;an work, such as the famous
Warrior Vase, there is evidence of the use of the small round shield,
while, moreover, in some parts of the poem there are evidences of
the use of the true Mycen&aelig;an shield 'like a tower.' Periphetes
of Mycen&aelig; is slain by Hector owing to his having tripped over
the lower edge of his great shield, and his slayer himself bears
a shield of no small proportions. 'So saying, Hector of the glancing
helm departed, and the black hide beat on either side against his
ankles and his neck, even the rim that ran uttermost about his
bossed shield.' So that the poems represent a gradual development
in the use of armour which may not unfairly be compared with the
similar development traceable in the Mycen&aelig;an remains.
</p>

<p class="indent">
On the whole, then, our conclusion is something like this: The
civilization which Schliemann discovered is not precisely that
of the Homeric poems, for the bloom of it belongs to a period
considerably <a name="page_62"><span class="page">Page 62</span></a>
anterior to the period of Ach&aelig;an supremacy in Greece, and was
the work of a race differing from that of the chiefs who fought
at Troy; but, broadly speaking, what Homer describes is the same
civilization in its latest stage, when the men of Mycen&aelig;an
or Minoan stock who created it had passed under the dominion of
the invading Ach&aelig;an overlords. The Ach&aelig;an invasion
was not, like that which succeeded it, subversive of the great
culture that belonged to the conquered Mycen&aelig;an race; on
the contrary, the invaders entered into and became partakers of
it, carrying on its traditions until the gradual decay, which had
begun already before they made their appearance in Greece, was
terminated by the Dorian invasion, or whatever process of gradual
incursion by ruder tribes may correspond to what the later Greeks
called by that name. And it is this last stage of the Mycen&aelig;an
culture, still existing, though under Ach&aelig;an supremacy, which
is depicted in the Homeric poems. 'Take away from the picture,'
says Father Browne, 'all the features which have been borrowed
from the Dorian invasion, give the post-Dorian poets the credit of
the references to iron and other post-Dorian things, and nothing
remains to disprove the view of those who hold that Schliemann
found&mdash;not, indeed, the tomb of Agamemnon&mdash;but the tomb
of that Homeric life which Agamemnon represents to us. In the
Mycen&aelig;an remains we have uncovered before our eyes the material
form of that impulse of which we had already met the spiritual in
the Homeric page.'[*]

CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="subtitle">THE PALACE OF 'BROAD KNOSSOS'</p>

<p class="indent">
In the revival of interest in the origins of Greek civilization
it was manifest that Crete could not long be left out of account,
for the traditions of Minos and his laws, and of the wonderful
works of D&aelig;dalus, pointed clearly to the fact that the great
island must have been an early seat of learning and art. Most of
these traditions clustered round Knossos, the famous capital of
Minos, where once stood the Labyrinth, and near to which was Mount
Juktas, the traditional burying-place of Zeus. The remains apparent
on the site of the ancient capital were by no means imposing. In 1834
Pashley found that 'all the now existing vestiges of the ancient
metropolis of Crete are some rude masses of Roman brick-work';
and Spratt in 1851 saw very little more, mentioning only 'some
scattered foundations and a few detached masses of masonry of the
Roman time,' though in the time of the Venetian occupation there
was evidently more to be seen, as Cornaro speaks of 'a very large
quantity of ruins, and in particular a wall, many paces long and
very thick.' <a name="page_64"><span class="page">Page 64</span></a>
But expectation still fixed on Knossos as the most probable site
for any Cretan discoveries.

(<i>p</i>. <a href="#page_69">69</a>)</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">
The attention of Schliemann and Stillman had been drawn to a hill
called 'Kephala,' overlooking the ancient site of Knossos, on which
stood ruined walls consisting of great gypsum blocks engraved with
curious characters; but attempts at exploration were defeated by
the obstacles raised by the native proprietors. In 1878 Minos
Kaloch&aelig;rinos made some slight excavations, and found a few
great jars or <i>pithai</i>, and some fragments of Mycen&aelig;an
pottery; but up to the year 1895, when Dr. A. J. Evans secured a
quarter of the Kephala site from one of the joint proprietors,
nothing of any real moment had been accomplished. Dr. Evans had been
attracted to Crete by the purchase at Athens of some seal-stones
found in the island, engraved with hieroglyphic and linear signs
differing from Egyptian and Hittite characters. In the hope that
he might be led to the discovery of a Cretan system of writing, and
relying upon the ancient Cretan tradition that the Ph&oelig;nicians
had not invented letters, but had merely changed the forms of an
already existing system, he began in 1894 a series of explorations
in Central and Eastern Crete. On all hands more or less important
evidence of the existence of such a script came to light, especially
from the Dict&aelig;an Cave, where a stone libation-altar was found,
inscribed with a dedication in the unknown writing. But Dr. Evans
was persuaded that Knossos was the spot where exploration was most
likely to be rewarded, <a name="page_65"><span class="page">Page
65</span></a> and his purchase of part of the site of Kephala in
1895 was the beginning of a series of campaigns which have had
results not less romantic than those of Schliemann, and even more
important in their additions to our knowledge of the prehistoric
&AElig;gean civilization.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The political troubles of the time were unfavourable to exploration.
Fighting was going on in the island, and religious prejudices ran
very high. When the new political order came into being with the
appointment of Prince George of Greece as Commissioner, an obstacle
was still found in the way in the shape of a French claim to prior
rights of excavation. This, however, was finally withdrawn on the
advice of Prince George, and in the beginning of 1900 Dr. Evans
was at last able to secure the remainder of the site, and on March
23 in that year excavation began, and was carried on with a staff
of from 80 to 150 men until the beginning of June.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Almost at once it became apparent that the faith which had fought
so persistently for the attainment of its object was going to be
rewarded. The remains of walls began to appear, sometimes only a
foot or two, sometimes only a few inches below the surface of the
soil, and by the end of the nine weeks' campaign of exploration about
two acres of a vast prehistoric building had been unearthed&mdash;a
palace which, even at this early stage in its disclosure, was already
far larger than those of Tiryns and Mycen&aelig;. On the eastern
slope of the hill, in a deposit of pale <a name="page_66"><span
class="page">Page 66</span></a> clay, were found fragments of the
black, hand-made, polished pottery, known as 'bucchero,' characteristic
of neolithic sites, some of it, as usual, decorated with incised
patterns filled in with white. This pottery was coupled with stone
celts and maces, obsidian knives, and a primitive female image of
incised and inlaid clay. All over the palace area, as the excavations
went farther and farther down, the neolithic deposit was found to
overlie the virgin soil, sometimes to a depth of 24 feet, showing
that the site had been thickly populated in remote prehistoric
times.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But the neolithic deposit was not the most striking find. On the
south-west side of the site there came to light a spacious paved
court, opening before walls faced with huge blocks of gypsum. At
the southern corner of this court stood a portico, which afforded
access to this portion of the interior of the palace. The portico
had a double door, whose lintel had once been supported by a massive
central column of wood. The wall flanking the entrance had been
decorated with a fresco, part of which represented that favourite
subject of Mycen&aelig;an and Minoan art&mdash;a great bull; while
on the walls of the corridor which led away from the portal were
still preserved the lower portions of a procession of life-size
painted figures. Conspicuous among these was one figure, probably
that of a Queen, dressed in magnificent apparel, while there were
also remains of the figures of two youths, wearing gold and silver
belts and loin-cloths, one of them bearing a fluted marble vase <a
name="page_67"><span class="page">Page 67</span></a> with a silver
base. At the southern angle of the building, this corridor&mdash;the
'Corridor of the Procession'&mdash;led round to a great southern
portico with double columns, and in a passage-way behind this portico
there came to light one of the first fairly complete evidences of
the outward fashion and appearance of the great prehistoric race
which had founded the civilization of Knossos and Mycen&aelig;.
This was the fresco-painting, preserved almost perfectly in its
upper part, of a youth bearing a gold-mounted silver cup
(<a href="#plate_VI">Plate VI.</a>). His loin-cloth is decorated
with a beautiful quatrefoil pattern; he wears a silver ear-ornament,
silver rings on the neck and the upper arm, and on the wrist a
bracelet with an agate gem.
</p>

<p class="indent">
'The colours,' says Dr. Evans in teat brilliant article in the
<i>Monthly Review</i> which first gave to the general public the
story of his first season's discoveries, 'were almost as brilliant
as when laid down over three thousand years before. For the first
time the true portraiture of a man of this mysterious Mycen&aelig;an
race rises before us. The flesh-tint, following, perhaps, an Egyptian
precedent, is of a deep reddish-brown. The limbs are finely moulded,
though the waist, as usual in Mycen&aelig;an fashions, is tightly
drawn in by a silver-mounted girdle, giving great relief to the hips.
The profile of the face is pure and almost classically Greek....
The lips are somewhat full, but the physiognomy has certainly no
Semitic cast.... There was something very impressive in this vision
of brilliant youth and of <a name="page_68"><span class="page">Page
68</span></a> male beauty, recalled after so long an interval to our
upper air from what had been, till yesterday, a forgotten world.
Even our untutored Cretan workmen felt the spell and fascination.
They, indeed, regarded the discovery of such a painting in the
bosom of the earth as nothing less than miraculous, and saw in it
the icon of a Saint! The removal of the fresco required a delicate
and laborious piece of under-plastering, which necessitated its
being watched at night, and old Manolis, one of the most trustworthy
of our gang, was told off for the purpose. Somehow or other he
fell asleep, but the wrathful saint appeared to him in a dream.
Waking with a start, he was conscious of a mysterious presence;
the animals round began to low and neigh, and "there were visions
about"; "&phi;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&alpha;&zeta;&epsilon;&iota," he said,
in summing up his experiences next morning, "the whole place
spooks!"'[*]

<p>GREAT JAR WITH TRICKLE ORNAMENT</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">
The Southern Portico gave access to a large court which turned out,
from later investigation, to have been really the Central Court of
the palace, the focus of the life of the whole huge building. The
block of building between the West and the Central Courts was divided
into two by a long gallery (<a href="#plate_VII">Plate VII.</a>),
3.40 metres in breadth, running almost the whole length of the
structure, and paved with gypsum blocks. Between this gallery and the
western wall of the palace lay a long range of what had evidently
been magazines for the storage of oil, and perhaps of corn. They were
occupied by rows <a name="page_69"><span class="page">Page 69</span></a>
of huge earthenware jars, or <i>pithoi</i>, sufficiently large to
have held the Forty Thieves, or to have accommodated the soldiers
of Tahuti in their venture on Joppa (<a href="#plate_VIII">Plates
VIII.</a> and <a href="#plate_IX">IX.</a>). In one of the magazines
no fewer than twenty of these jars were found. They were all ornamented,
some of them very elaborately, with spiral and rope-work patterns; one
of them, found, not in a magazine, but in a small room near the Central
Court, was particularly elaborate in its adornment, and stood almost
five feet in height (<a href="#plate_X">Plate X. 2</a>). Down the
centre line of each magazine ran a row of small square openings in
the floor&mdash;'kaselles,' as they came to be called&mdash;which at
one time had evidently been receptacles, some of them, perhaps, for
oil, but some of them certainly for valuables. They were carefully
lined with lead, and in some cases the slabs of stone covering them
could not be removed without lifting the whole pavement. In spite of
such precautions, however, they had been well rifled in ancient days,
and little was left to tell of what their contents may once have been.
The magazines were well fitted to convey a strong impression, not only
of the size, but also of the splendour of the palace which needed such
storerooms. There was no meanness or squalor about the domestic
offices of the House of Minos. The doorways leading into the magazines
from the Long Corridor were of fine stone-work, and the side-walls,
both of the gallery and the magazines, had been covered with painted
plaster, presenting a white ground on which ran a dado of horizontal
bands of <a name="page_70"><span class="page">Page 70</span></a> red
and blue, further bands of the same colours forming a frieze below
the ceiling level. This, of course, had been merely the basement of
the palace, and had been surmounted by another storey or storeys,
of which nothing was left except fragments of the painted plaster
which had once decorated the walls.
</p>

<p class="indent">
To the rooms composing the block of building between the Long Gallery
and the Central Court, access had been given from the latter area;
and it was in these rooms that, as the excavations progressed, some
of the most remarkable features of the palace began to disclose
themselves. About halfway along the court were found two small
rooms, connected with one another, in the centre of each of which
stood a single column composed of four gypsum blocks, each block
marked with the sign of the Double Axe; and these pillars suggested
a connection with ancient traditions about Minos and his works
(<a href="#plate_XI">Plate XI.</a>). They were apparently sacred
emblems connected with the worship of a divinity, and the Double Axe
markings pointed to the divinity in question. For the special emblem
of the Cretan Zeus (and also apparently of the female divinity of whom
Zeus was the successor) was the Double Axe, a weapon of which numerous
votive specimens in bronze have been found in the cave-sanctuary of
Dicte, the fabled birthplace of the god. And the name of the Double Axe
is Labrys&mdash;a word found also in the title of the Carian Zeus, Zeus
of Labraunda. But tradition linked the names of <a name="page_71"><span
class="page">Page 71</span></a> Minos and Knossos with a great and
wonderful structure of D&aelig;dalus which went by the name of
the Labyrinth; and the coincidence between that name and the Labrys
marks on the sacred pillars and on many of the blocks in the palace
at once suggested that here was the source of the old tradition,
and here the actual building, the Labyrinth, which D&aelig;dalus
reared for his great master. 'There can be little remaining doubt,'
says Dr. Evans, 'that this vast edifice, which in a broad historic
sense we are justified in calling the "Palace of Minos," is one
and the same as the traditional "Labyrinth." A great part of the
ground-plan itself, with its long corridors and repeated successions
of blind galleries, its tortuous passages and spacious underground
conduit, its bewildering system of small chambers, does, in fact,
present many of the characteristics of a maze.'[*] The connection
thus suggested even by the first year's excavations has grown more
and more probable with the work of each successive season.

<p class="indent">
Passing farther north along the line of the Central Court, access
was given by a row of four steps to an ante-chamber, which opened
upon another room, of no great size in itself, but of surpassing
interest from the character of its appointments. 'Already, a few
inches below the surface, freshly preserved fresco began to appear.
Walls were shortly uncovered, decorated with flowering plants and
running water, while on each side of the doorway of a small <a
name="page_72"><span class="page">Page 72</span></a> inner room,
stood guardian griffins with peacock's plumes in the same flowery
landscape. Round the walls ran low stone benches, and between these,
on the north side, separated by a small interval, and raised on a stone
base, rose a gypsum throne with a high back, and originally covered with
decorative designs. Its lower part was adorned with a curiously carved
arch, with crocketed mouldings, showing an extraordinary anticipation
of some most characteristic features of Gothic architecture. Opposite
the throne was a finely wrought tank of gypsum slabs&mdash;a feature
borrowed perhaps from an Egyptian palace&mdash;approached by a
descending flight of steps, and originally surmounted by cypress-wood
columns, supporting a kind of <i>impluvium</i>. Here truly was the
council chamber of a Mycen&aelig;an King or Sovereign Lady.'[*]
The discovery of the very throne of Minos, for such we may fairly
term it, was surely the most dramatic and fitting recompense for the
explorer's patience and persistence. No more ancient throne exists
in Europe, or probably in the world, and none whose associations are
anything like so full of interest (<a href="#plate_I">Plate I.</a>).
</p>

<p class="footnote">

</p>

<p class="indent">
The Throne Room still preserved among its d&eacute;bris many relics of
former splendour. Fragments of blue and green porcelain, of gold-foil,
and lapis lazuli and crystal, were scattered on the floor, and several
crystal plaques with painting on the back, among them an exceedingly
fine miniature of a galloping bull on an azure ground; while an agate
plaque, <a name="page_73"><span class="page">Page 73</span></a>
bearing a relief of a dagger laid upon a folded belt, almost equalled
cameo-work in the style and delicacy of its execution. In a small
room on the north side of the Central Court was found a curiously
quaint and delicate specimen of early fresco painting&mdash;the
figure of a Little Boy Blue&mdash;more thoroughly deserving of the
title than Gainsborough's famous picture, for, strangely enough,
he is blue in his flesh-tints, picking and placing in a vase the
white crocuses that still dapple the Cretan meadows.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The northern side of the palace was finished with another portico,
and in this part of the building there came to light a series of
miniature frescoes, valuable, not only as works of art, but as
contemporary documents for the appearance, dress, and surroundings
of the mysterious people to whom this great building was once home.
Here were groups of ladies with the conventional white complexion
given by the Minoan artists to their womankind, wonderfully bedizened
with costumes resembling far more closely the evening dress of
our own day than the stately robes of classic Greece with their
severe lines. In their very low-necked dresses, with puffed sleeves,
excessively slender waists, and flounced skirts, and their hair
elaborately dressed and curled, they were as far as possible removed
from our ideas of Ariadne and her maids of honour, and might almost
have stepped out of a modern fashion-plate. 'Mais,' exclaimed a
French savant, on his first view of them, 'Mais ce sont des
Parisiennes.' These fine Court ladies were seated, or perhaps rather
<a name="page_74"><span class="page">Page 74</span></a> squatted,
according to the curious Minoan custom, in groups, conversing in
the courts and gardens, and on the balconies of a splendid building.
In the spaces beyond were groups of men, of the same reddish-brown
complexion as the Cup-bearer, wearing loin-cloths and footgear with
puttees halfway up the leg, their long black hair done up into a
crest on the crown of the head. In one group alone thirty men appear
close to a fortified post; in another, youths are hurling javelins
against a besieged city. 'The alternating succession of subjects
in these miniature frescoes suggests the contrasted episodes of
Achilles' shield. It may be that we have here parts of a continuous
historic piece; in any case these unique illustrations of great
crowds of men and women within the walls of towns and palaces supply
a new and striking commentary on the familiar passage of Homer
describing the ancient populousness of the Cretan cities.'[*] Only
the wonderful tomb paintings of ancient Egypt can excel these vivid
miniatures in bringing before us the life of a bygone civilization;
nothing else to approach them has come down from antiquity.

<p class="indent">
The main entrance of the palace seemingly lay on the north side,
where the road from the harbour, three and a half miles distant, ran
up to the gates. Here was the one and only trace of fortification
discovered in all the excavations. The entrance passage was a stone
gangway, on the north-west side of which stood a great bastion, with
a guard <a name="page_75"><span class="page">Page 75</span></a> room
and sally-port&mdash;a slender apology for defence in the case of
a prize so vast and tempting as the Palace of Knossos. Obviously the
bastion, with its trifling accommodation for an insignificant guard,
was never meant to defend the palace against numerous assailants,
or a set siege; it could only have been sufficient to protect it
against the sudden raid of a handful of pirates sweeping up from the
port (<a href="#plate_XII">Plate XII. 2</a>). How was it that so great
and rich a structure came to be left thus practically defenceless? The
mainland palaces of the Mycen&aelig;an Age at Tiryns and Mycen&aelig;
are, so to speak, buried in fortifications. Their vast walls, 57 feet
thick in some parts at Tiryns, 46 feet at Mycen&aelig;, towering still
after so many centuries of ruin to a height of 24&frac12; feet in the case
of the smaller citadel, and of 56 feet at the great stronghold of
Agamemnon; their massive gateways, and the ingenious devices by
which the assailant was obliged to subject himself in his approach
to a destructive fire on his unshielded side&mdash;everything about
them points to a land and a time in which life and property were
continually exposed to the dangers of war, and the only security
was to be found within the gates of an impregnable stronghold.
But Knossos, far richer, far more splendid, than either Tiryns
or Mycen&aelig;, lies virtually unguarded, its spacious courts
and pillared porticoes open on every side. Plainly, the Minoan
Kings lived in a land where peace was the rule, and where no enemy
was expected to break rudely in upon <a name="page_76"><span
class="page">Page 76</span></a> their luxurious calm. And the reason
for their confidence and security is not far to seek, if we remember
the statements of Thucydides and Herodotus.

<p>A GREAT JAR, KNOSSOS</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">
'The first King known to us by tradition as having established
a navy is Minos,' says the great Athenian historian. The Minoan
Empire, like our own, rested upon sea-power; its great Kings were
the Sea-Kings of the ancient world&mdash;the first Sea-Kings known
to history, over-lords of the &AElig;gean long before 'the grave
Tyrian trader' had learned 'the way of a ship in the sea,' or the
land-loving Egyptian had ventured his timid squadrons at the command
of a great Queen so far as Punt. And so the fortifications of their
capital and palace were not of the huge gypsum blocks which they
knew so well how to handle and work. They were the wooden walls,
the long low black galleys with the vermilion bows, and the square
sail, and the creeping rows of oars, that lay moored or beached
at the mouth of the Kairatos River, or cruised around the island
coast, keeping the Minoan peace of the &AElig;gean. So long as the
war-fleet of Minos was in being, Knossos needed no fortifications.
No expedition of any size could force a landing on the island.
If the crew of a chance pirate-galley, desperate with hunger, or
tempted by reports of the wealth of the great palace, succeeded
in eluding the vigilance of the Minoan cruisers, and made a swift
rush up from the coast, there was the bastion with its armed guard,
enough to deal with the handful of men who could be detached for
such <a name="page_77"><span class="page">Page 77</span></a> a
dare-devil enterprise. But in the fleet of Knossos was her fate;
and if once the fleet failed, she had no second line of defence on
which to rely against any serious attack. There is every evidence
that the fleet did fail at last. The manifest marks of a vast
conflagration, perhaps repeated more than once during the long
history of the palace, and the significant fact that vessels of
metal are next to unknown upon the site, while of gold there is
scarcely a trace, with the exception of scattered pieces of gold-foil,
appear to indicate either that the Minoan Sovereigns failed to
maintain the weapon which had made and guarded their Empire, or
that the Minoan sailors met at last with a stronger fleet, or more
skilful mariners. Sea-power was lost, and with it everything.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Near the main north entrance of the palace was found one of the
great artistic treasures of the season's work. This was a plaster
relief of a great bull's head, which had once formed part of a
complete figure. These figures of bulls, as we have already seen in
connection with the Palace of Tiryns, were among the most favourite
subjects of Mycen&aelig;an and Minoan art; but nothing so fine as
the Knossos relief had yet been discovered. 'It is life-sized,
or somewhat over, and modelled in high relief. The eye has an
extraordinary prominence, its pupil is yellow, and the iris a bright
red, of which narrower bands again appear encircling the white towards
the lower circumference of the ball. The horn is of greyish-blue,
and both this and the other parts of <a name="page_78"><span
class="page">Page 78</span></a> the relief are of exceptionally
hard plaster, answering to the Italian <i>gesso duro</i>.... Such
as it is, this painted relief is the most magnificent monument of
Mycen&aelig;an plastic art that has come down to our time. The
rendering of the bull, for which the artists of the period showed
so great a predilection, is full of life and spirit. It combines in
a high degree naturalism with grandeur, and it is no exaggeration
to say that no figure of a bull, at once so powerful and so true,
was produced by later classical art.'[*] <a href="#plate_XIII">Plate
XIII.</a> shows that this high praise is not undeserved; to match
the naturalism of this magnificent Minoan monster one must turn to
the Old Kingdom tomb reliefs of Egypt, or to the exquisite Eighteenth
Dynasty statue of a cow unearthed in 1906 by Naville from the Temple
of Mentuhotep Neb-hapet-Ra, at Deir-el-Bahri.

<p class="footnote">

<p class="indent">
But the discovery which will doubtless prove in the end to be of
greater importance than any other, though as yet the main part of
its value is latent, was that of large numbers of clay tablets
incised with inscriptions in the unknown script of the Minoans. By
the end of March the finding of one tablet near the South Portico
gave earnest of future discoveries, and before the season ended over
a thousand had been collected from various deposits in the palace.
Of these deposits, one contained tablets written in hieroglyphic;
but the rest were in the linear script, 'a highly developed form,
with regular divisions between the words, and for elegance scarcely
surpassed <a name="page_79"><span class="page">Page 79</span></a>
by any later form of writing.' The tablets vary in shape and size,
some being flat, elongated bars from two to seven and a half inches
in length, while others are squarer, ranging up to small octavo.
Some of them, along with the linear writing, supply illustrations
of the objects to which the inscriptions refer. There are human
figures, chariots and horses, cuirasses and axes, houses and barns,
and ingots followed by a balance, and accompanied by numerals which
probably indicate their value in Minoan talents. It looks as though
these were documents referring to the royal arsenals and treasuries.
'Other documents, in which neither ciphers nor pictorial illustrations
are to be found, may appeal even more deeply to the imagination.
The analogy of the more or less contemporary tablets, written in
cuneiform script, found in the Palace of Tell-el-Amarna, might
lead us to expect among them the letters from distant governors
or diplomatic correspondence. It is probable that some of them are
contracts or public acts, which may give some actual formul&aelig; of
Minoan legislation. There is, indeed, an atmosphere of legal nicety,
worthy of the House of Minos, in the way in which these records were
secured. The knots of string which, according to the ancient fashion,
stood in the place of locks for the coffers containing the tablets,
were rendered inviolable by the attachment of clay seals, impressed
with the finely engraved signets, the types of which represented a
great variety of subjects, such as ships, chariots, religious scenes,
lions, bulls, and other <a name="page_80"><span class="page">Page
80</span></a> animals. But&mdash;as if this precaution was not in
itself considered sufficient&mdash;while the clay was still wet
the face of the seal was countermarked by a controlling official,
and the back countersigned and endorsed by an inscription in the
same Mycen&aelig;an script as that inscribed on the tablets
themselves.'[*]

<p class="footnote">

The tablets had been stored in coffers of wood, clay, or gypsum.
The wooden coffers had perished in the great conflagration which
destroyed the palace, and only their charred fragments remained;
but the destroying fire had probably contributed to the preservation
of the precious writings within, by baking more thoroughly the clay
of which they were composed. As yet, in spite of all efforts, it
has not proved possible to decipher the inscriptions, for there has
so far been no such good fortune as the discovery of a bilingual
inscription to do for Minoan what the Rosetta Stone did for Egyptian
hieroglyphics. But it is not beyond the bounds of probability that
there may yet come to light some treaty between Crete and Egypt
which may put the key into the eager searcher's hands, and enable
us to read the original records of this long-forgotten kingdom
(<a href="#plate_XIV">Plate XIV.</a>).

<p class="indent">
Even as it is, the discovery of these tablets has altered the whole
conception of the relative ages of the various early beginnings
of writing in the Eastern Mediterranean area. The Hellenic script
is seen to have been in all likelihood no late-born child of the
Ph&oelig;nician, but to have had an ancestor of its own race; and the
old Cretan tradition on <a name="page_81"><span class="page">Page
81</span></a> which Dr. Evans relied at the commencement of his
work, has proved to be amply justified. 'In any case,' said Dr.
Evans, summing up his first year's results, 'the weighty question,
which years before I had set myself to solve on Cretan soil, has
found, so far at least, an answer. That great early civilization
was not dumb, and the written records of the Hellenic world were
carried back some seven centuries beyond the date of the first-known
historic writings. But what, perhaps, is even more remarkable than
this, is that, when we examine in detail the linear script of these
Mycen&aelig;an documents, it is impossible not to recognize that we
have here a system of writing, syllabic and perhaps partly alphabetic,
which stands on a distinctly higher level of development than the
hieroglyphs of Egypt, or the cuneiform script of contemporary Syria
and Babylonia. It is not till some five centuries later that we
find the first dated examples of Ph&oelig;nician writing.'[*]

<p class="indent">
Among the other finds of this wonderful season's work were several
stone vases, of masterly workmanship, in marble, alabaster, and
steatite, a few vases in pottery of the stirrup type (a type common
on other Mycen&aelig;an sites, but noticeably rare at Knossos,
probably because in the great palace the bulk of such vases were
of metal, and were carried off by plunderers in the sack), and
a noble head of a lioness, with eyes and nostrils inlaid, which
had evidently once formed part of a fountain. One other discovery
was most precious, <a name="page_82"><span class="page">Page
82</span></a> not for its own artistic value, which is slight enough,
but for the link which it gives with one of the other great sister
civilizations of the ancient world. This was the lower part of a
small diorite statuette of Egyptian workmanship, with an inscription
in hieroglyphic which reads: 'Ab-nub-mes-Sebek-user maat-kheru'
(Ab-nub's child, Sebek-user, deceased). The name of the individual
and the style of the statuette point to Sebek-user, whoever he
may have been, having been an Egyptian of the latter days of the
Middle Kingdom, probably about the Thirteenth Dynasty. This is the
first link in the chain of evidence, which, as we shall see later,
shows the continuous connection between the Minoan and Nilotic
civilizations.

<p class="indent">
Nine weeks after the excavations on the hill of Kephala had begun,
the season's work was closed, and, surely, never had a like period
of time been more fruitful of fresh knowledge, more illuminative
as to the conditions of ancient life, or more destructive of hoary
prejudices. It was a new world, new because of its very ancientry,
that had begun to rise out of the buried past at the summons of
the patient explorer.

CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="subtitle">THE PALACE OF 'BROAD KNOSSOS' (<i>continued</i>)</p>

<p class="indent">
The discoveries of 1900, important as they were, were evidently
far from having exhausted the hidden treasures of the House of
Minos; but even the explorer himself, who spoke of his task as
being 'barely half completed' by the first year's work, had no
conception of the magnitude of the task which yet lay before him,
or of the richness of the results which it was destined to produce.
The early work in the second year led to a further disclosure of
the large area of the Western Court of the palace, which seems
to have formed the meeting-place between the citizens of Knossos
and their royal masters. Here probably all the business between
the town and the palace-folk was transacted; stores were brought
up, received and paid for by the palace stewards, and passed into
the great magazines; and here, perhaps, the ancients of the Knossian
Assembly gathered in council to discuss affairs, as the men of
the Greek host gathered in the Iliad, while the King sat in state
in the Western Portico, presiding over their deliberations. <a
name="page_84"><span class="page">Page 84</span></a> The Portico
itself, with its wooden central pillar, 16 feet in height, must
have been a sufficiently imposing structure, while the great court
on which it opened, more than 160 feet in length, must have formed
a stately meeting-place for the citizens. Whether as market-place
or open-air council-room, this West Court must have presented a
gay and animated spectacle when the prosperity of the Minoan Empire
was at its height. Along the outer wall of the palace fronting the
court ran a projecting base, which served as a seat where merchants
or suppliants might wait, sheltered from the sun by the shadow of
the vast building at their backs, till their business fell to be
disposed of (<a href="#plate_XV">Plate XV. 1</a>). Meanwhile they
could beguile the time by watching the ever-changing picture in
front of them, where gay courtier figures, with gold and jewels on
neck and arm, mingled with grave citizens of substance from the
town, or gathered round some Egyptian visitor, newly arrived on
board one of the Keftiu ships, to discuss some matter of
trade&mdash;a clean-cut and austere-looking figure, in his garb of
pure white linen, beside the more gaudily clothed Minoans. When
their eyes wearied of the glare of sunlight on the red cement
pavement and the brilliant crowd, they could turn to the wall
behind them, where above their heads ran a broad zone of paintings
in fresco&mdash;shrines with scenes of religion, conventional
decorations, and lifelike representations of the great bulls which
played so conspicuous, and sometimes so tragic, a part in the Minoan
economy.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_85"><span class="page">Page 85</span></a> But the
main discoveries of the season were to lie on the opposite side of
the building from the Western Court. The Central Court, instead of
being, as it had seemed at first, the boundary of the building on
the eastern side, was now found to have been the focus of the inner
life of the palace. For on its eastern margin, as the excavations
progressed, there came to light a mass of building, fully equal
in importance to that on the western side, and perhaps of even
greater interest. Here the slope of the ground had been such that
storey had been piled above storey, even before the level of the
Central Court had been reached, so that on this side it was not
only the basement of the building that had been preserved, but a
whole complex of rooms going down from the central area to different
levels, and connected with one another by a great staircase, which,
in the course of this and subsequent seasons' excavations, was found
to have had no fewer than five flights of steps. Of this staircase,
thirty-eight steps are still preserved, and good fortune had so
brought it about that at the destruction of the palace some of the
upper chambers had fallen in such a manner that their d&eacute;bris
actually propped up the staircase and some of the upper floorings,
and kept them in place; and thus it has been possible to reconstruct
a large part of the arrangement of the various rooms and floors in
this quarter of the building (<a href="#plate_XVI">Plate XVI. 1</a>).
Far down below the level of the Central Court lay a fine Colonnaded
Hall about 26 feet square, <a name="page_86"><span class="page">Page
86</span></a> from which the great staircase, with pillars and
balustrades, led to the upper quarter (<a href="#plate_XVII">Plate
XVII. 2</a>), while adjoining it was a stately and finely-proportioned
hall&mdash;the Hall of the Double Axes&mdash;about 80 feet in length
by 26 feet in breadth, and divided transversely by a row of square-sided
pillars (<a href="#plate_XVII">Plate XVII. 1</a>). In this part of the
building, and especially in the Colonnaded Hall, the conflagration in
which the glories of Knossos found their close had been extremely
severe, and the evidences of fierce burning were everywhere. In a
small room in an upper storey, whose floor was near the present surface
of the ground, there came to light also evidence which suggested that
the catastrophe of the palace, in whatever form it may have come,
came suddenly and unexpectedly. The room had evidently been a
sculptor's workshop, and the artist who used it had been employed in
the fabrication of those splendid vessels of carved stone in which
the Minoan magnates delighted. One of them still stood in the room,
finished and ready for transport. It was carved from a veined
limestone approaching to marble in texture, and was of noble
proportions, standing 27&frac14; inches in height, while its girth
was 6 feet 8&frac34; inches, and its weight such that it took eleven
men to carry it from the room where it had waited so long for its
resurrection. Its workmanship was superb. The upper rim was decorated
with a spiral band, while round the bulging shoulder ran another
spiral, whose central coils rose up in bold relief into forms like
the shell of a snail, and <a name="page_87"><span class="page">Page
87</span></a> its three handles bore another spiral design. But beside
it stood another amphora, smaller than its neighbour, and giving
unmistakable proof that the artist's work had been suddenly interrupted,
for it had only been roughed out, and its decoration had not been begun.
The skilful hand that should have finished it had perhaps to grasp
sword or spear in the last vain attempt to repel the assault of the
invader, and we can only wonder over his half-done work, and imagine
what untoward fate befell the worker, and for what unknown master, if
he survived the sack, he may have exercised the skill that once
gratified the refined taste of his Minoan lord.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Not far from the sculptor's workshop, and in the same quarter of
the palace, was found a splendid and convincing proof of the
magnificence of the appointments of the House of Minos in its palmy
days. This was a board which had evidently been designed for use
in some game, perhaps resembling draughts or chess, in which men
were moved to and fro from opposite ends. The board was over a
yard in length, and rather more than half a yard in breadth. Its
framework was of ivory, which had originally been overlaid with thin
gold plate, and it was covered with a mosaic of strips and discs
of rock-crystal, which in their turn had been backed alternately
with silver and blue enamel paste. Round its margin ran a border of
marguerites whose central bosses were convex discs of rock-crystal
which had probably been set originally in a blue paste background.
At the top of the board <a name="page_88"><span class="page">Page
88</span></a> were four beautiful reliefs representing nautilus
shells, set round with crystal plaques, and bossed with crystal.
Below them came four large medallions, set among crystal bars backed
with silver plate, and then eleven bars of ribbed crystal and ivory,
alternating with one another. Eight shorter bars of crystal backed
with blue enamel fill spaces on either side of the topmost section
in the lower part of the board, which consists of a two-winged
compartment with ten circular openings, the medallions of which
have been broken out, but were probably of crystal backed with
silver. The remaining space of the board was filled with flat bars
of gold-plated ivory alternating with bars of crystal on the blue
enamel setting. The mere summary of its decoration conveys no idea
of the splendour of a piece of work which, as Professor Burrows says,
'defies description, with its blaze of gold and silver, ivory and
crystal.' The Late Minoan monarch who used it&mdash;for so gorgeous
a piece of workmanship can scarcely have been designed for anyone but
a King&mdash;must have been as splendid in his amusements as in all
the other appointments of his royalty (<a href="#plate_XVIII">Plate
XVIII.</a>).
</p>

<p class="indent">
The gaming-board suggested the lighter and more innocent side of
the palace life. A darker and more tragic aspect of it was hinted
at by the fresco which was found in the following season among
d&eacute;bris fallen from a chamber overlooking the so-called Court
of the Olive Spout. This was a picture of those sports of the arena
in which the <a name="page_89"><span class="page">Page 89</span></a>
Minoan and Mycen&aelig;an monarchs evidently took such delight,
and in which the main figures were great bulls and toreadors. In
this case the picture is one of three toreadors, two girls and
a boy, with a single bull. The girls are distinguished by their
white skins, their more vari-coloured costumes, their blue and
red diadems, and their curlier hair, but are otherwise dressed
like their male companion. In the centre of the picture the great
bull is seen in full charge. The boy toreador has succeeded in
catching the monster's horns and turning a clean somersault over
his back, while one of the girls holds out her hands to catch his
as he comes to the ground. But the other girl, standing in front
of the bull, is just at the critical moment of the cruel sport.
The great horns are almost passing under her arms, and it looks
almost an even chance whether she will be able to catch them and
vault, as her companion has done, over the bull's back, or whether
she will fail and be gored to death. With such a sport, in which
life or death depended upon an instant, in which a slip of the
foot, a misjudgment of distance, or a wavering of hand or eye meant
horrible destruction, we may be sure that the tragedies of the
Minoan bull-ring were many and terrible, and that the fair dames
of the Knossian Palace, modern in costume and appearance as they
seem to us, were as habituated to scenes of cruel bloodshed as
any Roman lady who watched the sports of the Colosseum, and saw
gladiators hack one another to pieces for her pleasure.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_90"><span class="page">Page 90</span></a> That the
sport of the bull-ring, and particularly this exciting and dangerous
game of bull-grappling, or
&tau;&alpha;&nu;&rho;&omicron;&kappa;&alpha;&theta;&alpha;&psi;&iota;&alpha;,
was an established and habitual form of Minoan sport is proved by the
multitude of representations of it which have survived. The charging
bull of Tiryns, the first to be discovered, was a mystery so long as
it stood alone; but it is only one of a succession of such
pictures&mdash;painted upon walls, engraved upon gems, and stamped on
seal impressions&mdash;which show that the Cretans and Mycen&aelig;ans
were as fond of their bull-fights as a modern Spaniard of his.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Where did they get the toreadors, male and female, whose lives were
to be devoted to such a terrible sport&mdash;a sport practically
bound to end fatally sooner or later? We may be fairly sure, at
all events, that bull-grappling was not taken up voluntarily even
by the male, and still less by the female, toreadors; and one of
the discoveries made in the excavations of 1901, and followed up
later, gave its own suggestion of an explanation. Not very far
from the North Entrance of the palace, beneath the room where,
the year before, had been found the fresco of the Little Boy Blue
gathering crocuses&mdash;an innocent figure to cover so grim a
revelation&mdash;there came to light the walls of two deep pits,
going right down, nearly 25 feet, to the virgin soil. The pits
were lined with stone-work faced with smooth cement, and it seems
most probable that these were the dungeons of the palace, in which
we may imagine that the miserable captives <a name="page_91"><span
class="page">Page 91</span></a> brought back by the great King's
fleet from its voyages of conquest and plunder, and the human tribute
paid by the conquered states, dragged out their existence until
the time came for them either to be trained for the cruel sport
to which they were devoted, or actually to take their places in
the bull-ring. If it be so, then the dungeons of Minos would keep
their captives securely enough; escape from the deep pits, with their
smooth and slippery walls, must have been practically impossible,
save by connivance on the part of the guards, or by the intervention
of some tender-hearted Ariadne.
</p>

<p class="indent">
If those dark walls could only reveal the story of the doomed lives
which they once imprisoned, we should probably be able to realize,
even more fully than we do, the shadowed side of all the glittering
splendour of Knossos, and the grim element of barbaric cruelty
which mingled with a refined artistic taste and a delight in all
forms of beauty. In none of these great civilizations of the ancient
world were splendour and cruelty separated by any great interval
from one another, nor was a very remarkable degree of refinement
inconsistent with a carelessness of life, and even such a thirst
for blood, as we would consider more natural in a savage state;
but it is seldom that the evidences of the two things lie so close
to one another as where at Knossos the innocent figure of the
crocus-gatherer almost covers the very mouth of the horrible pit
in which the captives of Minos waited for the day when their lives
were to be staked on the hazard of the arena.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_92"><span class="page">Page 92</span></a> Among the
other treasures recovered by this season's work was a quantity of
fine painted pottery which had fallen from the upper rooms into
the basement when the palace floors collapsed. Some of the fragments
were of that early polychrome style known as 'Kamares ware,' from
the cave on the southern slope of Mount Ida, where it was first
discovered by Mr. J. L. Myres. Its designs are purely conventional
and largely geometric&mdash;zigzags, crosses, spirals, and concentric
semicircles&mdash;and are executed in beautiful tints of brown, red,
yellow, black, and white, the design being sometimes in dark on a
light ground, and sometimes in light upon dark. The extraordinary
thinness of the walls of these polychrome vessels, and the fineness
of the clay from which they are fabricated, show to what a pitch the
potter's craft had reached at the early period to which they belong.
Of the later pottery of Knossos, which substituted naturalistic
motives, executed in monochrome, for the conventional polychrome
designs of the Kamares period, many specimens were also found during
the excavations of this season.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The frescoes of the previous year were supplemented by the discovery
of a number of others, representing zones of human figures, about
one-third of life-size, set out on blue and yellow fields with
triple borders of black, red, and white bands. One well-preserved
figure is that of a girl with very large eyes, lips of brilliant
red, and curling black hair. Her high-bodied dress is looped up
at the <a name="page_93"><span class="page">Page 93</span></a>
shoulder with a bunch of blue, with red and black stripes, and
fringed ends. A border of the same robe, adorned with smaller loops,
crosses the bosom, and between its blue and red bands the white
tint of the skin displays itself, showing that the material of
the robe was diaphanous. Relief work in stucco was represented
by fragments of a life-sized figure, since pieced together by M.
Gilli&eacute;ron, which must have been that of some Minoan King.
The head wears a fleur-de-lys crown and peacock plumes, and round
the neck of the finely modelled torso there runs a collar of
fleur-de-lys ornament.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Again the connection of Knossos with Egypt was evidenced, and this
time in most interesting fashion. Near the wall of a bathroom which
was unearthed by the north-west side of the North Portico, there was
found the lid of an Egyptian alabastron, bearing the cartouche of
a King, which reads, 'Neter nefer S'user-en-Ra, sa Ra Khyan.' These
are the names of one of the most famous Kings of the enigmatical
Hyksos race&mdash;Khyan&mdash;'the Embracer of the Lands,' as he
called himself, one of whose memorials, in the shape of a lion
figure, carved in granite, and bearing his cartouche upon its breast,
was found as far east as Baghdad, and is now in the British Museum.
The statuette of Sebek-user, son of Ab-nub, evidenced a connection
between Knossos and Egypt in the time of the later Middle Kingdom.
This cartouche of Khyan shows that the connection was maintained
in that dark period of Egyptian history which lay between <a
name="page_94"><span class="page">Page 94</span></a> the fall of
the Middle Kingdom and the rise of the Empire. The intercourse
between Crete and Egypt, however, goes much farther back than either
the domination of the Hyksos or the Middle Kingdom. The discovery
of various stone vessels in translucent diorite, and other hard
materials familiar to the student of Early Egyptian work as
characteristic of the taste of the earliest dynasties, shows that
for the beginning of the connection between the two great Empires
we must go back to the early days of the Old Kingdom in Egypt. The
two civilizations, as we shall see later, can be equated period
by period from the earliest times until the catastrophe of Knossos.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Among the seal impressions in clay, which were found in considerable
numbers this season, were two worthy of attention: the one of great
importance, the other scarcely of importance, but at least of interest.
The first was an impression of the figure of a female divinity,
dressed in the usual flounced garb of the Mycen&aelig;an period,
standing upon a sacred rock on which two guardian lions rest their
forefeet, the arrangement of the design being very much the same
as that of the relief on the Lion Gate at Mycen&aelig;, only with
the figure of the goddess taking the place of the sacred pillar. In
her hands the goddess holds something which may be either a weapon
or a sceptre, and before her stands a male votary in an attitude of
adoration. In the background is a shrine with sacred columns, in
front of which rise the 'horns of consecration,' which were <a
name="page_95"><span class="page">Page 95</span></a> characteristic
of Minoan temples, as apparently also of other Eastern religious
structures. The second discovery was a clay matrix, formed from
the impression of an actual seal, and evidently designed for the
purpose of providing counterfeit impressions. In fact, we have
here an evidence, brought to light after three millenniums, of some
very ancient attempt at forgery in the very palace of the great
law-giver.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The main result of the season of 1902 was the practical reconstruction
of a large part of the Eastern or Domestic Quarter of the palace.
The chief room in this part of the building was the Queen's Megaron,
an inner chamber divided transversely by a row of pillars, along
whose bases ran a raised seat, where, no doubt, the maids of honour
of the Minoan Court were wont to sit and gossip. The pillared portico
opened upon another elongated area, a characteristic feature of
Minoan architecture, which served the purpose of a light-shaft,
illuminating the inner room. The light-well had been covered with
a brilliant white plaster, on which were the remains of a bird
fresco&mdash;a long, curving wing, with feathers of red, blue,
yellow, white, and black. Adjacent to the Queen's Megaron was a
small bathroom, constructed for a portable bath&mdash;a fragment
of which, in painted terra-cotta, was found in the portico of the
adjoining hall.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The fresco of the bull-fight, already referred to, was paralleled in
subject, and more than matched in artistic quality, by the discovery,
in a small secluded room which had apparently served as a <a
name="page_96"><span class="page">Page 96</span></a> treasury, of
a deposit of ivory figurines of the most exquisite workmanship.
The height of the best preserved specimen is about 11&frac12; inches,
and it is hard to say whether the boldness of the design or the
precision with which the details of the tiny figure are wrought out
is the more admirable. The attitude is that of a man flinging himself
forth in the abandon of a violent leap, with legs and arms extended.
His straining muscles are indicated with perfect faithfulness, and
even the veins in the diminutive hand and the nails of the tiny
fingers are clearly marked. The hair had been formed by curling
strands of thin gold wire inserted in the skull. There can be no doubt
that these figures formed part of a scene like that of the toreador
fresco, for the violent motion suggested is consistent with nothing
but some desperate feat of agility like bull-grappling. Probably the
leaping figures were suspended by thin gold wires over the backs of
ivory bulls, and thus presented a realistic miniature reproduction
of the Minoan bull-ring. The extraordinary multiplication of such
scenes, in painting, in the round, on gems and seal impressions,
helps one to realize the hold which the passion of bull-fighting,
or, rather, bull-grappling, had upon the Cretan mind, a hold no
doubt connected with the important part which the bull appears
to have played in the Minoan religion (<a href="#plate_XIX">Plate
XIX.</a>).

One of the season's finds was peculiarly useful and interesting, as
having yielded a considerable mass of material for reconstructing
the appearance <a name="page_97"><span class="page">Page 97</span></a>
of a Minoan town. A great chest of cypress wood&mdash;in which
perhaps some Knossian Nausicaa once kept her store of linen&mdash;had
been decorated with a series of enamelled plaques, depicting a
Minoan town, with its towers and houses, its fields and cattle
and orchards. The chest itself had perished in the conflagration
of the palace, leaving only a charred mass of woodwork; but the
plaques survived. Some of them represent houses, evidently of wood
and plaster fabric, for the round ends of the beams show in the
frontage. On the ground-floor are the doors, in some cases double;
above are second and third storeys, with rows of windows fitted with
some red material, which may have been oiled and tinted parchment,
while some of the houses have an attic storey with windows above the
third floor. It is evident that the houses of the Minoan burghers
were not the closely-packed mud hovels, separated from one another
only by narrow alleys, which characterize the plan of the Egyptian
town discovered by Petrie at Illahun, but were substantial structures,
giving accommodation which, even to modern ideas, would seem
respectable. Of course, one must suppose that the poorer quarters
of the town would scarcely be represented on a fabric designed
for use in the palace; but the actual remains of a Minoan town,
unearthed at Gournia by Mrs. H. B. Hawes, show that that town,
at least, was largely composed of houses which must have pretty
closely resembled those on the porcelain plaques of Knossos.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Most surprising of all, however, in many respects, <a
name="page_98"><span class="page">Page 98</span></a> was the revelation
of the amazingly complete system of drainage with which the palace
was provided. The gradient of the hill which underlay the domestic
quarter of the building enabled the architect to arrange for a
drainage system on a scale of completeness which is not only
unparalleled in ancient times, but which it would be hard to match
in Europe until a period as late as the middle of the nineteenth
century of our era. A number of stone shafts, descending from the
upper floors, lead to a well-built stone conduit, measuring 1 metre
by 1/2 metre, whose inner surface is lined with smooth cement.
These shafts were for the purpose of leading into this main conduit
the surface-water from the roofs of the palace buildings, and thus
securing a periodical flushing of the drains. In connection with
this surface-water system, there was elaborated a system of latrines
and other contrivances of a sanitary nature, which are 'staggeringly
modern' in their appointments.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In the north-eastern quarter, under the Corridor of the Game-Board,
are still preserved some of the terra-cotta pipes which served as
connections to the main drain. They are actually faucet-jointed
pipes of quite modern type, each section 2&frac12; feet in length and
6 inches in diameter at the wide end, and narrowing to 4 inches at
the smaller end. 'Jamming was carefully prevented by a stop-ridge
that ran round the outside of each narrow end a few inches from the
mouth, while the inside of the butt, or broader end, was provided
with a raised collar that enabled it to <a name="page_99"><span
class="page">Page 99</span></a> bear the pressure of the next pipe's
stop-ridge, and gave an extra hold for the cement that bound the
two pipes together'[*] (<a href="#plate_XX">Plate XX. 2</a>).

<p class="indent">
Indeed, the hydraulic science of the Minoan architects is altogether
wonderful in the completeness with which it provided for even the
smallest details. On a staircase near the east bastion, on the
lower part of the slope, a stone runnel for carrying off the surface
water follows the line of the steps. Lest the steepness of the
gradient should allow the water to descend too rapidly and flood
the pavement below, the runnel is so constructed that the water
follows a series of parabolic curves, and the rapidity of its fall
is thus checked by friction. The main drains are duly provided
with manholes for inspection, and 'are so roomy,' says Dr. Evans,
'that two of my Cretan workmen spent days within them clearing out
the accumulated earth and rubble without physical inconvenience.'
Those who remember the many extant descriptions of the sanitary
arrangements, or rather the want of sanitary arrangements, in such
a town as the Edinburgh of the end of the eighteenth century, will
best appreciate the care and forethought with which the Minoan
architects, more than 3,000 years earlier, had provided for the
sanitation of the great Palace of Minos (<a href="#plate_XVI">Plates
XVI. 2</a> and <a href="#plate_XX">XX. 1</a>).
</p>

<p class="indent">
Turning from the material to the spiritual, evidence as to the
religious conceptions of the inhabitants of the palace was forthcoming
in two instances. In one early chamber there was found a little
painted <a name="page_100"><span class="page">Page 100</span></a>
terra-cotta object consisting of a group of three columns standing
on an oblong platform. The square capitals of the columns each
carried two round beams, their ends showing, exactly as in the
case of the pillar on the Lion Gate at Mycen&aelig;; and on the top
of the beams doves were perched. Here is the evidence of a cult in
which a Dove Goddess&mdash;a Goddess of the Air&mdash;was worshipped
under the form of a trinity of pillars; and confirmation of the
existence of such a form of belief was afforded by the discovery,
in the south-east corner of the palace, of a little shrine, in which,
along with the usual 'horns of consecration' and sacred Double Axes,
were found three figures of a goddess, of very archaic form, on
the head of one of which there was also perched a dove. The Double
Axes in the shrine again emphasized the importance in the palace
worship of the Labrys, and underlined the suggestion that the Palace
of Knossos is nothing more nor less than the legendary Labyrinth of
Minos. 'That the <i>Labrys</i> symbol should be the distinguishing
cult sign of the Minoan Palace makes it more and more probable that
we must in fact recognize in this vast building, with its maze of
corridors and chambers and its network of subterranean ducts, the
local habitation and name of the traditional Labyrinth.'[*]

<p class="indent">
The season of 1903 was marked by two important discoveries within
the palace area. Of these we may first consider the so-called Theatral
Area. <a name="page_101"><span class="page">Page 101</span></a> (<a
href="#plate_XXI">Plates XXI.</a> and <a href="#plate_XXII">XXII.</a>).
Such an area had been found at Ph&aelig;stos by the Italian explorers,
and it was natural to expect that something corresponding to it would
not be lacking at Knossos. When found, it proved to be of later date
and of more developed form than the structure at Ph&aelig;stos; but
the general idea was the same. At the extreme north-west angle of the
palace, abutting on the West Court, there was discovered a paved area
about 40 by 30 feet, divided up the centre by a causeway. On its
eastern and southern sides it was overlooked by two tiers of steps,
the eastern tier having at one time consisted of eighteen rows, while
the greatest number on the south side was six, diminishing to three as
the ground sloped upwards. At the southeastern angle, where the two
tiers met, a bastion of solid masonry projected between them.

<p>RELIEF OF BULL'S HEAD (<i>p</i>.
 <a href="#page_77">77</a>)</p>
<p>From 'The Palace of Minos,' by Arthur J. Evans, in <i>The Monthly
 Review</i>.</p>
</div>

<p class="indent">
This area, for whatever purpose it may have been designed, was
evidently an integral portion of the Later Palace structure, for no
fewer than five causeways converge upon it from different directions;
but it was in no sense a thoroughfare, and the rows of steps around
it do not lead, and can never have led, anywhere. What can have been
the purpose of its existence? Dr. Evans's view, which is generally
accepted, is that it was some sort of a primitive theatre, where
the inhabitants of the palace gathered to witness sports and shows
of some kind, the tiers of steps affording sitting accommodation
for them, while the bastion at the south-east angle may have been
a kind of Royal Box, from which Minoan <a name="page_102"><span
class="page">Page 102</span></a> majesty and its Court circle surveyed
the games. There would be accommodation on the steps for some four
or five hundred spectators.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It must be confessed that the place leaves much to be desired as
a theatre. The shallow steps must have made somewhat uncomfortable
sitting-places, though one must remember that the Minoan ladies
often, apparently, adopted a sitting posture which was more like
squatting than sitting, and that a seat found in 1901, evidently
designed for a woman's use, was only a trifle over 5 inches in
height. But male dignity required more lofty sitting accommodation;
the seat of the throne of Minos is nearly 23 inches high, and the
spectators of the Knossian theatre cannot have been all women.
Neither does the shape of the area appear to be particularly well
adapted to the purpose suggested; and, on the whole, if it were really
designed for a theatre, we must admit that the Minoan architects
were less happily inspired in its erection than in most of their
other works. At the same time, however, the obstinate fact remains
that we can suggest no other conceivable purpose which the place can
have served; and so, until some more likely use can be suggested,
we are scarcely entitled to demur to Dr. Evans's theory.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Admitting, then, for want of any better explanation, that it may
have been a Theatral Area, what were the games or shows which were
here presented to the Minoan Court and its dependents? Certainly
not the bull-fight. For that there is manifestly no space, as the
flat area is not larger than a good-sized <a name="page_103"><span
class="page">Page 103</span></a> room; while the undefended position
of the spectators would as certainly have resulted in tragedies
to them as to the toreadors. But from the great rhyton found at
Hagia Triada, from a steatite relief found at Knossos in Igor,
and from various seal-impressions, we know that boxing was one
of the favourite sports of the Minoans, as it was of the Homeric
and the classical Greeks; and the Theatral Area may have served
well enough for such exhibitions as those in which Epeus knocked
out Euryalus, and Odysseus smashed the jaw of Irus. Or perhaps
it may have been the scene of less brutal entertainments in the
shape of dances, such as those which delighted the eyes of Odysseus
at the Palace of Alcinous. To this day the Cretans are fond of
dancing, and in ancient times the dance had often a religious
significance, and was part of the ceremonial of worship. So that
it is not impossible that we have here a spot whose associations
with the House of Minos are both religious and literary&mdash;'the
Choros (or dancing-ground) which D&aelig;dalus wrought in broad
Knossos for fair-haired Ariadne' (Iliad XVIII., 590).
</p>

<p class="indent">
If the Theatral Area be really the scene of the palace sports,
it has for us a romantic as well as an historical interest; for
Plutarch tells us that it was at the games that Ariadne first met
Theseus, and fell in love with him on witnessing his grace and
prowess in the wrestling ring. It may be permissible to indulge
the imagination with the thought that we can still behold the very
place where, while the <a name="page_104"><span class="page">Page
104</span></a> grim King and his gaily-bedecked courtiers looked
on at the sports which were meant only as a prelude to a dreadful
tragedy, the actors in one of the great romances of the world found
love waiting for them before the gates of death. In any case, the
spot may well have been a most fitting one for the birth of an
immortal tale of love. For it is not improbable that, in its religious
aspect, it had a connection with a greater, a Divine namesake of
the human Ariadne. The great goddess of Knossos, in one aspect of
her nature, was the same whom the Greeks knew later as Aphrodite,
the foam-born Goddess of Love. To this goddess there was attached
in Crete the native dialect epithet of 'The Exceeding Holy One,'
'Ariadne,' and the Theatral Area may well have been the place where
ceremonial dances were performed in her honour.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Within the palace walls abundant remains of fine polychrome ware of
the Middle Minoan period were found as the season's work went on.
The dungeons of the preceding year's excavations were supplemented
by the discovery of four more, making six in all, and it was shown
that these pits must have belonged to a very early period in the
history of the buildings, for they have no structural connection
with the walls of the Later Palace, which, indeed, cross them in
some places. But the great discovery within the area was that of
the Temple Repositories. As the eastern side of the palace gave
evidence of having been the domestic quarter, so the west-central
part showed traces of having had a special <a name="page_105"><span
class="page">Page 105</span></a> religious significance in the
palace life. Religion, indeed, seems to have bulked very largely
in the economy of the House of Minos, which is what might have
been expected when one remembers the closeness of the relations
between Zeus and Minos as depicted in the legends, and realizes
that very probably the Kings of Knossos were Priest-Kings, and
perhaps even incarnations of the Bull-god.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Near the west-central part of the palace the Double Axe sign occurred
very frequently, and other evidences seemed to suggest that somewhere
in this vicinity there must have been a sanctuary of some sort.
This season's explorations confirmed the suggestion, for, near
the Pillar Room at the west side of the Central Court, there were
discovered two large cists, which had been used for the storage of
objects connected with the palace cult. The cist which was first
opened was closely packed, to a depth of 1.10 metres, with vases; and
below these there was a deposit of fragments and complete examples
of fa&iuml;ence, including the figures of a Snake Goddess and her
votaresses, votive robes and girdles, cups and vases with painted
designs, and reliefs of cows and calves, wild goats and kids. In
fact, this Repository was a perfect treasure-house of objects in
fa&iuml;ence; but in the second cist such objects were wanting,
with the exception that a missing portion of the Snake Goddess
was found, the place of the fa&iuml;ence being taken by gold-foil
and crystal plaques.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Some of the small fa&iuml;ence reliefs are of particularly <a
name="page_106"><span class="page">Page 106</span></a> exquisite
design and execution, particularly one of a Cretan wild-goat and
her young, the subject being executed in pale green, with dark
sepia markings, and characterized by great directness and naturalism
of treatment. Most interesting, however, were the figures of the
Snake Goddess and her votaresses. The goddess is 13&frac12; inches
in height. She wears a high tiara of purplish-brown, with a white
border, and her dress consists of a richly embroidered jacket,
with laced bodice, and a skirt with a short double <i>panier</i>
or apron. Her hair is dressed in a fringe above her forehead, and
falls behind on her neck and shoulders; the eyes and eyebrows are
black, and the ears are of extraordinary size; the bust is almost
entirely bare. But the curious feature of the little figure is
that around her are coiled three snakes. One, which is grasped in
the right hand, passes up the arm, descends behind the shoulders
and down the left arm to the hand, which holds the tail. Two other
snakes are interlaced around her hips, and a fourth coils itself
around the high tiara. The figure of the votaress is somewhat similar;
but her skirt is flounced all the way down in the regular Minoan
style, and she holds a snake in her right hand. The characteristic
feature of both figures is the modernness of their lines, which
are as different as possible from those of the statues of classic
Greece. The waist is exceedingly slender, and altogether 'the lines
adopted are those considered ideal by the modern corset-maker rather
than those of the sculptor.'
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_107"><span class="page">Page 107</span></a> There
can be little doubt that these tiny figures point to the worship
of an earth goddess, whose emblem is the snake&mdash;the other
aspect of the heavenly divinity whose symbols are the doves. It may
be noted that at Gournia Miss Boyd (Mrs. Hawes) found a primitive
figure of a goddess, twined with snakes and accompanied by doves,
together with a low, three-legged altar, and the familiar horns
of consecration. Strangely enough, along with the Snake Goddess
of Knossos there was found in the Temple Repositories a cross of
veined marble, with limbs of equal length, which Dr. Evans believes
to have actually been the central object of worship in the cult,
and which he has placed in this position in his reconstruction
of the little shrine. This discovery, 'pointing to the fact that
a cross of orthodox Greek shape was not only a religious symbol
of the Minoan cult, but an actual object of worship, cannot but
have a profound interest in its relation to the later cult of the
same emblem which still holds the Christian world.' The fact of
the equal-limbed cross having at so early a date been the object
of worship also suggests the reason why the Eastern Church has
always preferred the Greek form of cross to the unequal-limbed form
of the Western Church.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Outside the area of the palace proper discoveries of almost equal
importance were made. About 130 yards to the east of the Northern
Entrance there came to light the walls of a building which Dr. Evans
has designated the Royal Villa. It proved <a name="page_108"><span
class="page">Page 108</span></a> to be by far the finest example yet
discovered of Minoan domestic architecture on a moderate scale,
and contained a finely preserved double staircase; while among the
relics found within its walls were some very beautiful examples
of the ceramic art, including a fine 'stirrup' or 'false-necked'
vase of the Later Palace style, decorated in lustrous orange-brown
on a paler lustred ground. Still more beautiful was a tall painted
jar, nearly 4 feet in height, bearing an exquisite papyrus design
in relief (<a href="#plate_XXIII">Plate XXIII.</a>).
</p>

</div>

<p class="indent">
The main feature of the Villa was a long pillared hall, measuring
about 37 by 15 feet. At the one end of it was a raised da&iuml;s,
separated by a balustrade from the rest of the hall, and approached
by an opening in the balustrade with three steps. Immediately in face
of the opening a square niche breaks the wall behind the da&iuml;s,
and here stand the broken fragments of a gypsum throne. A fine stone
lamp of lilac gypsum stands on the second step of the da&iuml;s
(<a href="#plate_XXIV">Plate XXIV.</a>). The two rows of pillars
which run down the hall divide it into a nave and side aisles,
and the hall presents all the elements of a primitive basilica,
with its throne for the presiding Bishop or Priest-King. It is
possible that we have here the first suggestion of that style of
architecture which, passing through the stage where the King-Archon
of Athens sat in the 'Stoa Basilike' to try cases of impiety, found
its full development at last in the Roman Basilica, the earliest
type of Christian church. 'Is the Priest-King of Knossos, who here
<a name="page_109"><span class="page">Page 109</span></a> gave
his decisions,' says Professor Burrows, 'a direct ancestor of
Pr&aelig;tor and Bishop, seated in the Apse within the Chancel,
speaking to the people that stood below in Nave and Aisles?'[*]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote *: 'The Discoveries in Crete,' pp. 10, 11.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
So far in the explorations at Knossos metal-work had been conspicuous
by its absence. That the Minoans were skilled metal-workers was
obvious, for many of their ceramic triumphs presented manifest
indications of having been adaptations of metal forms; and the gold
cups of Vaphio, which, there can be little doubt, came originally
from Crete, bore witness to a skill which would not have disgraced
the best Renaissance goldsmiths. But the men, whoever they may
have been, who plundered the palace at the time of its great
catastrophe, had done their work thoroughly, and left behind them
little trace either of the precious metals or of bronze. It turned
out, however, that in a block of building which stands between the
West Court and the paved area to the north-west of the palace, a
strange chance had preserved enough to testify to the art of the
bronze-workers of Knossos. One of the floors of this building had
sunk in the conflagration before the plunderers had had time to
explore the room beneath, and under its d&eacute;bris were found
five magnificent bronze vessels&mdash;four large basins and a
single-handled ewer. The largest basin, 39 centimetres in diameter,
is exquisitely wrought with a foliated margin and handle, while
another has a lovely design of conventionalized lilies on its border.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_110"><span class="page">Page 110</span></a> Mention
has already been made of the paved causeway which bisects the Theatral
Area of the palace. This was found, in 1904, to have a continuation in
the shape of a well-made road leading in a north-westerly direction
towards the hillside (<a href="#plate_XII">Plate XII. 1</a>). It
was overlaid by a Roman roadway, and an interesting comparison
was thus made possible between the Minoan work and that of the
great road-makers of later days. The Roman road came out rather
badly from the comparison, the earlier construction being superior
in every respect. The central part of the Minoan road consisted of
a well-paved causeway, rather more than 4&frac12; feet wide, while
on either side of this there extended to a breadth of more than
3&frac12; feet a strip of pebbles, clay, and pounded potsherds rammed
hard, making the whole breadth of the road almost 12 feet. Close
by this first European example of scientific road-making ran the
remains of water conduits, which may have led from a spring on Mount
Juktas, and near the road also were found magazines of clay tablets,
giving details of numbers of chariots, bows, and arrows, while in
the immediate neighbourhood of these were two actual deposits of
bronze-headed shafts.
</p>

<p class="indent">
As the Minoan road was followed up in 1905, it led the explorers
towards an important building in the face of the hill to the north-west.
Its exploration was rendered extremely difficult by the fact that its
masonry ran right back into the side of the <a name="page_111"><span
class="page">Page 111</span></a> hill, which was covered by an olive
wood, beneath whose roots lay a stratum made up of the remains of
Gr&aelig;co-Roman houses. But the building, when explored, proved
to be well worth the labour, for the Little Palace, as it is called,
was an important structure with a frontage of over 114 feet, and
its pillared hall was worthy of comparison even with the fine rooms
of its great neighbour. In Late Minoan times part of this fine
hall had been used as a shrine, and in it were found, along with
the usual 'horns of consecration,' three fetish idols, grotesque
natural concretions of quasi-human type. Of these, the largest
had some resemblance to a woman of ample contours, while a smaller
nodule suggested the figure of an infant, and near it was a rude
representation of a Cretan wild-goat. The third nodule was of apelike
aspect. In view of all the religious associations of Crete, it
can scarcely be doubted that these grotesque images, 'not made
with hands,' represent Mother Rhea, the infant Zeus, and the goat
Amaltheia. The cult of stones, meteorites and concretions such as
these of the Little Palace, has been widespread in all ages; one
has only to remember the black stone which forms the most sacred
treasure of Mecca, the black stone which stood in the Temple of
the Great Mother at Rome, and the image of the great goddess Diana
at Ephesus, 'which fell down from Jupiter.' Hesiod's story of how
Kronos or Saturn devoured a stone under the belief that he was
swallowing the infant Zeus evidently belongs to the recollections
<a name="page_112"><span class="page">Page 112</span></a> of a
worship in which such natural idols as these were adored.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Hitherto Knossos had yielded only one small and inadequate
representation of that seafaring enterprise upon which the Minoan
power rested, though even this had, in its own way, a certain
suggestiveness of the romance and terror of the sea. It was a
seal-impression, found in 1903, in the Temple Repositories, on
which a great sea-monster, with dog's head and open jaws, is seen
rising from the waves and attacking a fisherman, who stands up in
his light skiff endeavouring to defend himself. The Little Palace
yielded a somewhat more adequate representation of the Minoan marine
in the shape of another seal-impression, which showed part of a
vessel carrying one square sail, and propelled also by a single
bank of oars, whose rowers sit under an awning. Imposed upon the
figure of the vessel is that of a gigantic horse, and the impression
has been construed as a record of the first importation of the
thoroughbred horse into Crete, probably from Libya, an interpretation
which seems to demand a certain amount of faith and imagination, for
Mosso's criticism, that 'the perspective is faulty,' is extremely
mild. But at least the representation of the vessel itself gives
us some idea of the galleys which maintained the Minoan peace in
the &AElig;gean.

Among other treasures yielded by the Little Palace was a vessel of
black steatite in the shape of a bull's head. The idea was already
familiar <a name="page_113"><span class="page">Page 113</span></a>
from other examples, but the execution of this specimen was beyond
comparison fine. 'The modelling of the head and curly hair,' says
Dr. Evans, 'is beautifully executed, and some of the technical
details are unique. The nostrils are inlaid with a kind of shell
like that out of which cameos are made, and the one eye which was
perfectly preserved presented a still more remarkable feature.
The eye within the socket was cut out of a piece of rock-crystal,
the pupil and iris being indicated by means of colours applied to
the lower face of the crystal which had been hollowed out, and
had a certain magnifying power.'[*] Students of Early Egyptian
art will be reminded of the details of the eyes in the statues
of Rahotep and Nefert, and in the bronze statue of Pepy. 'Even
after the Cnossian ivories, faience figurines, and faience and
plaster reliefs,' writes Mr. Hogarth, 'after the Cnossian and Haghia
Triadha frescoes, after the finest "Kamares" pottery, and the finest
intaglios, the Vaphio goblets and the Mycenc&aelig; dagger blades,
one was still not prepared for the bull's head <i>rhyton</i> ... with
its painted transparencies for eyes, and its admirable modelling,
and the striking contrast between the black polished steatite of
the mass and the creamy cameo shell of the inlay work.[**]

<p class="indent">
Within the palace proper, the work of 1907 witnessed the discovery
of a huge beehive chamber excavated in the rock underlying the
Southern Portico. <a name="page_114"><span class="page">Page
114</span></a> It had been filled in with later d&eacute;bris and
sherds of the Middle Minoan period, and evidently belonged to a
period antedating that of the construction of even the earliest
palace. Its floor was only reached in 1908 by a small shaft at
the depth of 52 feet from the summit of its cupola; and as yet the
floor remains largely unexplored, and may be expected to furnish
valuable information as to the Early Minoan culture. Professor Murray
has suggested that this huge underground vault may be the actual
Labyrinth of the legend, the underground Temple of the Bull-God, and
the scene of the dark tragedies which belong to the story of the
Minotaur; but for the confirmation or negation of this suggestion we
must wait until the great vault itself has been thoroughly explored.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Such, then, have been the outstanding results of the excavation
of the ancient palace of the Cretan Sea-Kings, so far as it has
yet proceeded. Of the wealth of material which has been brought to
light much, of course, still waits, and, perhaps, may long wait,
for interpretation. The facts are there, but the significance of
them is not always easily discerned. But, at least, the importance
of the supreme fact cannot be questioned; the emergence of this
magnificent relic of a civilization, so great and so advanced as to
fill the mind with wonder, so curiously corroborating the ancient
legends as to the greatness and power of the House of Minos, and
yet so absolutely lost as to have left no trace of itself, save in
romantic story, until the patience and skill of <a name="page_115"><span
class="page">Page 115</span></a> present-day explorers restored its
relics to the light of day to tell, though as yet only imperfectly,
their own tale of splendour and disaster.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The interpretation and co-ordination of the immense body of material
gathered by Dr. Evans must for long be the work of scholars. Perhaps
it is not too much to hope that when the Minoan script has at length
yielded up its secrets we shall be able to comprehend clearly those
historical outlines of the rise and magnificence and fall of a
great monarchy and culture, which at present have to be cautiously
and sometimes precariously inferred from the indications afforded
by scraps of potsherd and fragments of stone or metal. And then
the actual story of the House of Minos will appeal to all. To-day,
perhaps, the main impression left on the ordinary student by this
resurrection is one of sadness. Here was a kingdom so great and
so imposing, a civilization so highly advanced and so full of the
joy of living. And it has all passed away and been forgotten, with
its vivid life, and its hopes and fears; and we can only wonder
how life looked to the men and women who peopled the courts of
the vast palace, and what part was played by them in the fragments
of old legend that have come down to us.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The pathos of this aspect of his discoveries has not been missed by
the explorer. Writing of the restoration of the Queen's apartment
of the palace, a restoration rendered necessary by the decomposing
action of wind and rain on the long-buried materials, Dr. Evans
says: 'From the open court to the east, <a name="page_116"><span
class="page">Page 116</span></a> and the narrower area that flanks
the inner section of the hall, the light pours in between the piers
and columns just as it did of old. In cooler tones it steals into
the little bathroom behind. It dimly illumines the painted spiral
frieze above its white gypsum dado, and falls below on the small
terra-cotta bath-tub, standing much as it was left some three and
a half millenniums back. The little bath bears a painted design
of a character that marks the close of the great "Palace Style."
By whom was it last used? By a Queen, perhaps, and mother, for
some "Hope of Minos"&mdash;a hope that failed.'[*]

CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="subtitle">PH&AElig;STOS, HAGIA TRIADA, AND EASTERN CRETE</p>

<p class="indent">
We have followed the fortunes of the excavations at Knossos in
considerable detail, not only as being the most important, but as
illustrating also in the fullest manner the legendary and religious
history of Crete. But they are very far from being the only important
investigations which have been carried on in the island, and it
may even be said that, had Knossos never been excavated, it would
still have been possible, from the results of the excavations made
at other sites, to deduce the conclusion which has been arrived
at as to the supreme position of Crete in the early &AElig;gean
civilization.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Both in the Iliad and the Odyssey Ph&aelig;stos is mentioned along
with Knossos as one of the chief towns of Crete; and it is at and
near Ph&aelig;stos that the most extensive and important remains
of Minoan culture have been discovered, apart from the work at
Knossos. The splendid valley of the Messara, on the southern side
of the island, is dominated towards its seaward end by three hills,
rising in steps one above the other, and on the lowest of the <a
name="page_118"><span class="page">Page 118</span></a> three,
overlooking the plain, stood the Palace of Ph&aelig;stos, the second
great seat of the Minoan lords of Crete. As in the case of Knossos, a
few blocks of hewn stone, standing among the furrows of the cornfield
which occupied the site, were the only indications of the great
structure which had once crowned the hill, and it was the existence
of these which induced the Italian Arch&aelig;ological Mission to
attempt the excavation. In April, 1900, the first reconnaissance of
the ground was made, with no very encouraging results. By September
of the same year the great palace had been discovered, though, of
course, the full revelation of its features was a matter of much
longer time. The work has been carried on by Professor Halbherr,
Signor Pernier, and others, concurrently with the excavations of
Dr. Evans; and the result has been the revelation of a palace,
similar in many respects to the House of Minos at Knossos, though
on a somewhat smaller scale, and characterized, like the Labyrinth,
by distinct periods of building. At Ph&aelig;stos, indeed, the
remains of the earlier palace, consisting of the Theatral Area and
West Court, with the one-columned portico at its south end, are
of earlier date than the existing important architectural features
at Knossos, belonging to the period known as Middle Minoan II.,
the time when the beautiful polychrome Kamares ware was in its
glory, while the main scheme of the palace at Knossos, as at present
existing, must be placed somewhere in the following period, Middle
Minoan III.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_119"><span class="page">Page 119</span></a> This
first palace of Ph&aelig;stos had been destroyed, like the early
palace at Knossos, but not at the same time, for it apparently lasted
till the beginning of the Late Minoan period, while at Knossos the
catastrophe of the first palace took place at the end of Middle
Minoan II. From this fact it has been suggested that the first
destruction of Knossos was the result of civil war, in which the
lords of Ph&aelig;stos overthrew their northern brethren of the
greater palace, but the evidence seems somewhat scanty to bear
such an inference.
</p>

<p class="indent">
After the catastrophe at Ph&aelig;stos, a thick layer of lime mixed
with clay and pebbles was thrown over the remains of the ruined
structure as a preparation for the rebuilding of the palace, and
thus the relics of the earlier building, which are now unveiled
in close connection with the later work, though on a rather lower
level, were completely covered up before the second palace rose
upon the site. The Theatral Area at Ph&aelig;stos to some extent
resembles that of Knossos, but is simpler, lacking the tier of steps
at right angles to the main tier, and lacking also the Bastion,
or Royal Box, which at Knossos occupies the angle of the junction
of the two tiers. It consists of a paved court, ending, on the
west side, in a flight of ten steps, more than 60 feet in length,
behind which stands a wall of large limestone blocks. As at Knossos,
a flagged pathway ran across the area, obliquely, however, in this
case. Beneath the structure of the second palace were discovered
some of the chambers of the earlier <a name="page_120"><span
class="page">Page 120</span></a> building, with a number of very
fine Kamares vases (<a href="#plate_XXVI">Plate XXVI.</a>).
</p>

<p class="indent">
But the chief glory of the palace at Ph&aelig;stos is the great
flight of steps, 45 feet in width, which formed its state entrance,
the broadest and most splendid staircase that ever a royal palace
had (<a href="#plate_XXVI">Plate XXVI.</a>). 'No architect,' says
Mosso, 'has ever made such a flight of steps out of Crete.' At the
head of the entrance staircase stood a columned portico, behind
which was the great reception-hall of the palace. The halls and
courts of Ph&aelig;stos are comparable for spaciousness even with
the finest of those at Knossos, and, indeed, the Megaron, so called
(wrongly), of Ph&aelig;stos is a more spacious apartment than the
Hall of the Double Axes at the sister palace, the area of the
Ph&aelig;stos chamber being over 3,000 square feet, as against the
2,000 odd square feet of the Hall of the Double Axes. The Central
Court, 150 feet long by 70 broad, is a fine paved quadrangle, but
has not the impressiveness of the Central Court at Knossos, with
its area of about 20,000 square feet.
</p>

<p class="indent">
On the whole, the two palaces wonderfully resemble each other in
the general ideas that determine their structure, though, of course,
there are many variations in detail. But, as contrasted with the
sister palace, the stately building at Ph&aelig;stos has exhibited
a most extraordinary dearth of the objects of art which formed so
great a part of the treasures of Knossos. Apart from the Kamares vases
and one graceful flower fresco, little of <a name="page_121"><span
class="page">Page 121</span></a> importance has been found. The
comparative absence of metal-work at Knossos can be explained by
the greed of the plunderers who sacked the palace; but Ph&aelig;stos
is almost barren, not of metal-work alone. All the more interesting,
therefore, was the discovery, made in 1908, of the largest inscribed
clay tablet which has yet been found on any Minoan site. This was
a disc of terra-cotta, 6.67 inches in diameter, and covered on
both sides with an inscription which coils round from the centre
outwards. 'It is by far the largest hieroglyphic inscription yet
discovered in Crete. It contains some 241 signs and 61 sign groups,
and it exhibits the remarkable peculiarity that every sign has
been separately impressed on the clay while in a soft state by a
stamp or punch. It is, in fact, a printed inscription.'[*] One of
the hieroglyphs, frequently repeated, is the representation of the
head of a warrior wearing a feathered headdress which remarkably
resembles the crested helmets of the Pulosathu, or Philistines,
on the reliefs of Ramses III. at Medinet Habu. From his analysis
of the various signs Dr. Evans has concluded that the inscription
is not Cretan, but may represent a script, perhaps Lycian, in use
in the coast-lands of Asia Minor. No interpretation of the writing
can yet be given, but Dr. Evans has pointed out evidences of a
metrical arrangement among the signs, and has suggested that the <a
name="page_122"><span class="page">Page 122</span></a> inscription
may conceivably be a hymn in honour of the Anatolian Great Mother,
a goddess who corresponded to the Nature Goddess worshipped in
Minoan Crete, whose traditions have survived under the titles of
Rhea, Britomartis, Aphrodite Ariadne, and Artemis Dictynna. The
pottery in connection with which it was found dates it to at least
1600, perhaps to 1800, B.C.[**]

<p class="indent">
The hill of Hagia Triada, about two miles to the north-west of
Ph&aelig;stos, proved sufficiently fruitful to compensate the Italian
explorers for the incomprehensible barrenness of Ph&aelig;stos.
Here stand the ruins of the Venetian church of St. George, itself
built of stone which was hewn originally by Minoan masons. The
retaining wall of the raised ground in front of the church had
given way, exposing a section of arch&aelig;ological relics, Minoan
potsherds, and fragments of alabaster, to a depth of more than six
feet; and this accidental exposure led to the discovery of the Royal
Villa, which the lords of Ph&aelig;stos had erected as a dependency
of the great palace, or as a country seat. Hagia Triada proved to
be as rich in objects of artistic interest as Ph&aelig;stos had
been poor. Some of the fresco work discovered, in particular a scene
with a cat hunting a red pheasant, reminiscent of the hunting-cat
scene on the Mycen&aelig; dagger-blade, is of extraordinary merit.
The cat scene is judged by Professor Burrows to be superior in
vivacity to the famous Egyptian Eighteenth Dynasty tomb-picture
of the marsh-fowler with the trained cat, though to those familiar
with <a name="page_123"><span class="page">Page 123</span></a> the
wonderful dash of the Egyptian work in question this will seem a
hard saying.
</p>

<p class="indent">
There can be nothing but admiration, however, for the three astonishing
vases of black soapstone which were discovered at the villa. They
remain a most convincing evidence of the maturity of Minoan art,
and the mastery to which it had attained over the expression of
the human form in low relief. It has been already noticed that
the fine Minoan pottery is largely an imitation of earlier work
in metal, and this is true also of these stone vases. What the
Minoan craftsman was capable of when he was allowed to deal with the
precious metals we can see from the few specimens which have survived
to the present time. The Vaphio gold cups, with their bull-trapping
scenes, are generally admitted now to be of Cretan workmanship,
though found in the Peloponnese, and Benvenuto Cellini himself
need not have been ashamed to turn out such work, admirable alike
in design and execution. Little of such gold-work has survived, for
obvious reasons. The metal was too precious to escape the plunderer
in the evil days which fell upon the Minoan Empire; and the artistic
value of the vases and bowls would seem trifling to the conquerors
in comparison with the worth of the metal.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But the artists of the time worked not only in the precious metals,
but also in stone, trying to reproduce there the forms with which
they had decorated the vessels wrought in the costlier medium.
Probably, when the steatite was worked to its finished shape, <a
name="page_124"><span class="page">Page 124</span></a> it was covered
with a thin coating of gold-leaf, at least this suggestion, originally
made by Evans, has been confirmed in one instance, where part of
the gold-leaf was found still adhering to a vase discovered at
Palaikastro by Mr. Currelly. In the case of the Hagia Triada vases
the gold-coated steatite had no charms for the plunderer, who merely
stripped off the gold-leaf and left its foundation to testify to
us of the skill of these ancient craftsmen. The largest of the
three stands 18 inches in height. It is divided by horizontal bands
into four zones. Three of these show boxers in all attitudes of
the prize-ring&mdash;striking, guarding, falling; while the second
zone from the top exhibits one of the bull-grappling scenes so
common in Minoan art, with two charging bulls, one of them tossing
on his horns a gymnast who appears to have missed his leap and
paid the penalty. The figures are admirably modelled and true to
nature, save for the convention of the exaggeratedly slender Minoan
waist, which seems to create an impression of unusual height and
length of limb. The second vase (<a href="#plate_XXVII">Plate
XXVII.</a>) is much smaller, and represents a procession which
has been variously interpreted as a band of soldiers or marines
returning in triumph from a victory, or as a body of harvesters
marching in some sort of harvest thanksgiving festival. This
interpretation seems, on the whole, the more probable of the two.
In the middle of the procession is a figure, interesting from the
fact that he is so different from his companions. He has not the
usual pinched-in waist of <a name="page_125"><span class="page">Page
125</span></a> the Cretans, but is quite normally developed, and he
bears in his hand the <i>sistrum</i>, or metal rattle, which was
one of the regular sacred musical instruments of the Egyptians.
In all probability he is meant to represent an Egyptian priest,
though what he is doing in a Cretan festival it is hard to tell.
The three figures, possibly of women, who are following him, have
their mouths wide open, and are evidently singing lustily. One of
the figures, that of an elderly man, who appears to be the chief
of the party, is clad in a curious, copelike garment, which may
be either a ceremonial robe or a wadded cuirass. Apart from all
questions of what kind of incident the artist meant to represent,
the artistic value of his work is unquestionable. It has been said
of this little vase that 'not until the fifth century B. C. should
we find a sculptor capable of representing, with such absolute
truth, a party of men in motion.'
</p>

<p class="indent">
The smallest of the three vases, only 4 inches in height, bears the
representation of a body of soldiers with heads and feet showing
above and below their great shields, which are locked together
into a wall. The shields are evidently covered with hide, as the
bulls' tails still show upon them. But the interest centres in
two figures which stand apart from the others. One seems to be a
chieftain or general; he has long, flowing hair, a golden collar
round his neck, and bracelets on his arms, while in his outstretched
right hand he holds a long staff, which may be the shaft of a lance,
or, more probably, an emblem of authority, like the staves carried
by Egyptian nobles <a name="page_126"><span class="page">Page
126</span></a> and officials. His legs are covered halfway up to
the knee by a genuine pair of puttees, five turns of the bandage
being clearly marked. He appears to be giving orders to the other
figure, perhaps that of a captain or under-officer, who stands
before him in an attitude of respectful attention. The captain
is slightly lower in stature than his chief, though this may be
due to the fact that room has had to be found for the tall curving
plume of the low helmet which he wears. His neck is adorned with a
single torque, and he carries a long heavy sword sloped over his
right shoulder. Instead of wearing puttees, like his commander, he
wears half-boots, like those on the figurine discovered by Dawkins
at Petsofa. Neither the chieftain nor his officer appears to wear
any defensive armour; their only clothing is a scalloped loin-cloth,
slightly more heavily bordered in the case of the chief than in
that of the soldier; and the modelling of the bodies, with the
indications of muscular development, particularly in the legs of
the chieftain, is exceedingly fine, and of an accuracy marvellous
when the diminutive scale of the figures is considered. The little
vase is a valuable document for the appearance and equipment of
the warriors of those far-off times, but it is also a treasure
of art. 'The ideal grace and dignity of these two figures,' says
Professor Burrows, 'the pose with which they throw head and body
back, is beyond any representation of the human figure hitherto
known before the best period of Archaic Hellenic art.'
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_127"><span class="page">Page 127</span></a> The interest
of another of the Hagia Triada finds arises from the fact that it
appears to represent a religious ceremony in honour of the dead.
The object in question is a limestone sarcophagus covered with
plaster, on which various funerary ceremonies are painted. The
artistic merit of the work is small, for the figures are badly
drawn and carelessly painted, and in all likelihood represent the
decaying art of the Third Late Minoan period; but the subjects and
their arrangement are of importance (<a href="#plate_XXVIII">Plate
XXVIII.</a>). On one side of the sarcophagus a figure stands against
the door of a tomb. He is closely swathed, the arms being within his
wrappings, and his attitude is so immobile as to suggest that he
is dead. Towards him advance three figures, one bearing something
which, by a stretch of charity, may be described as the model of
a boat, the others bearing calves, which, curiously enough, are
represented, like the great bulls of the frescoes, as in full gallop.
At the other end of the panel a priestess pours a libation into
an urn standing between two Double Axes, with birds perched upon
them. Behind the priestess is a woman carrying over her shoulders
a yoke, from which hang two vessels, while behind her, again, comes
a man dressed in a long robe, and playing upon a seven-stringed
lyre. On the opposite side of the sarcophagus, the painting, much
defaced, shows another priestess before an altar, with a Double Axe
standing beside it, a man playing on a flute, and five women moving
in procession. On the ends of the sarcophagus are pictures, in one
case <a name="page_128"><span class="page">Page 128</span></a> of a
chariot drawn by two horses, and driven by two women; in the other,
of a chariot drawn by griffins and driven by a woman, who has beside
her a swathed figure, perhaps again representing a dead person. The
figures of the lyre and flute players are interesting as affording
very early information concerning the forms of European musical
instruments. The double flute employed shows eight perforations,
and probably the full number, allowing for those covered by the
player's hands, was fourteen. The lyre approximates to the familiar
classic form, and the number of its strings shows that Terpander can
no longer claim credit as being the inventor of the seven-stringed
lyre, which was in use in Crete at least eight centuries before the
date at which his instrument was mutilated by the unsympathetic
judges at Sparta to put him on a level with his four-stringed
competitors.

<p class="indent">
More important, however, is the suggestion of Egyptian influence
in the grouping of the figures. No one familiar with the details of
the ceremony of 'opening the mouth' of the deceased, so continually
represented in Egyptian funerary scenes, can fail to recognize the
original inspiration of the scene on the Hagia Triada sarcophagus.
The tomb in the background, the stiff swathed figure propped like
a log in front of it, the leafy branch before the dead man, taking
the place of the bunches of lotus-blooms, the offerings of meat, and
the sacrifice of the bull&mdash;this is an Egyptian funeral with the
mourners dressed in Cretan clothes. We have <a name="page_129"><span
class="page">Page 129</span></a> already seen a priest from the banks
of the Nile brandishing his sistrum in the Harvest Procession;
and the sarcophagus suggests that Egyptian religious influence
was telling, if not on the actual views of the Cretans as to the
state of man after death, at all events upon the ceremonial by
means of which these views were expressed. Ph&aelig;stos and Hagia
Triada, we must remember, owing to their position, would be more
exposed to Egyptian influence than even Knossos, where traces of
it are not lacking.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The villa at Hagia Triada showed the same attentive care for sanitary
arrangements which has been already noticed at Knossos. Mosso has
noted an illustration of the honesty with which the work had been
executed. 'One day, after a heavy downpour of rain, I was interested
to find that all the drains acted perfectly, and I saw the water
flow from sewers through which a man could walk upright. I doubt
if there is any other instance of a drainage system acting after
4,000 years.'
</p>

<p class="indent">
The excavations at Knossos, Ph&aelig;stos, and Hagia Triada have
yielded, in the main, evidence of the splendour of the Minoan Kings;
but other sites in the island, while presenting perhaps nothing so
striking, have added largely to our knowledge of the common life
of the Minoan race. At Gournia an American lady, Miss Harriet Boyd
(now Mrs. Hawes), made the remarkable discovery of a whole town,
mainly dating from the close of the Middle Minoan period, though
the site had been occupied from the beginning of the Bronze Age.
Gournia <a name="page_130"><span class="page">Page 130</span></a>
had had its modest palace, occupying an area of about half an acre,
with its adaptation, on a diminutive scale, of the Knossian Theatral
Area, its magazines, and its West Court, where palace and town
met, as at Knossos, for business purposes. But the main interest
of the little town centred in its shrine and in the houses of the
burghers, with their evidences of a wonderfully even standard of
comfortable and peaceful life, by no means untinged with artistic
elegance.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The shrine, discovered in 1901, stood in the very heart of the
town, and was reached by a much-worn paved way. The sacred enclosure
was only some 12 feet square, and Mrs. Hawes is inclined to believe
that its rough walls never stood more than 18 inches high, forming
merely a little <i>temenos</i>, in which stood a sacred tree, and
the small group of cult objects which were still huddled together in
a corner of the shrine. 'It is true that they are very crude, made
in coarse terra-cotta, with no artistic skill; nevertheless, they are
eloquent, for they tell us that the Great Goddess was worshipped in
the town-shrine of Gournia, as in the Palace of Knossos. Here were her
images twined with snakes, her doves, the "horns of consecration,"
the low, three-legged altar-table, and cultus vases. To complete the
list, a potsherd was found with the Double Axe moulded upon it, an
indication, perhaps, that some who claimed kin with the masters of
Crete paid their devotions at this unpretentious shrine.'[*] The
<a name="page_131"><span class="page">Page 131</span></a> smallness
of the shrine at Gournia may be compared with the smallness of the
sacred rooms at Knossos, and seems to have been characteristic
of the Minoan worship.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote *: 'Crete the Forerunner of Greece,' p. 98.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The 5-feet-broad roadways of the town, neatly paved, are conclusive
evidence of the infrequent use of wheeled vehicles. Flush with their
borders stand the fronts of the houses. Two-storey houses were
common, some of them with a basement storey beneath the ground-floor
when the slope of the hill admitted of such an arrangement. In all
likelihood the general appearance of the homes was much like that
of the comfortable-looking houses depicted on the fa&iuml;ence plaques
of Knossos, already referred to. Even ordinary craftsmen's houses
have six to eight rooms, while those of the wealthier burghers
have perhaps twice as many. Here and there evidences of the former
occupations of the inhabitants came to light&mdash;a complete set
of carpenter's tools in one house, a set of loom weights in another,
the block-mould in which a smith had cast his tools in a third.
That the citizens of the little town were not entirely ignorant
of letters was evidenced by the presence of a tablet bearing an
inscription in the linear script of Knossos, Class A, and the beauty
of their painted pottery shows that they were by no means lacking
in refinement and artistic feeling. The town was sacked and burned
about 1500 B.C., as its discoverer thinks, perhaps a century before
the fall of the great palace at Knossos. Partially reoccupied,
like other Cretan sites, during the Third Late Minoan period, <a
name="page_132"><span class="page">Page 132</span></a> it has since
then lain tenantless, waiting the day when its ruined houses should
be revealed again to testify to the quiet and peaceful prosperity
that reigned under the &aelig;gis of the great sea-power of the
House of Minos.
</p>

<p class="indent">
At Palaikastro another town of closely-packed houses, covering a
space of more than 400 by 350 feet, has been revealed. Its existing
remains are of somewhat later date than those of Gournia, and the
houses are, on the whole, rather larger, but their general style
is much the same. Near the town, at Petsofa, Professor J. L. Myres
has unearthed, among a wealth of other votive offerings, a number
of curious clay figurines, interesting as being among the earliest
examples of polychrome decoration (they belong to Middle Minoan I.,
and are painted in a scheme of black and white, red and orange), but
still more interesting&mdash;'with their open corsage, wide-standing
collars, high shoe-horn hats, elaborate crinolines, and their general
impression of an inaccurate attempt at representing Queen
Elizabeth'&mdash;as evidence of how utterly unlike was the costume
of prehistoric woman in the &AElig;gean area to the stately and
simple lines of the classic Greek dress.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The Cretan discoveries have tended as much as any work of recent years
to reduce the extravagant claims which used to be put forward on
behalf of the Ph&oelig;nicians as originators of many of the elements
of ancient civilization, and evidence is now forthcoming to show that
originality in even their most famous and characteristic industry, the
dyeing of <a name="page_133"><span class="page">Page 133</span></a>
robes with the renowned 'Tyrian purple,' must be denied to them and
claimed for the Minoans. In 1903, Messrs. Bosanquet and Currelly
found on the island of Kouphonisi (Leuke), off the south-east coast
of Crete, a bank of the pounded shell of the murex from which the
purple dye was obtained, associated with pottery of the Middle
Minoan period; and in 1904 they discovered at Palaikastro two similar

At Zakro, on the eastern coast of the island, Mr. Hogarth has excavated
the remains of what must have been an important trading-station.
In one single house of one of its merchants he came upon 500 clay
seal-impressions, with specimens of almost every type of Cretan
seal design, which had evidently been used for sealing bales of
goods. Some of the Zakro pottery also was of extreme beauty, one
specimen in particular, conspicuous from the fact that its delicate
decoration had been laid on subsequent to the firing of the vessel,
and could be removed by the slightest touch of the finger, showing
evident traces of Egyptian influence in its adaptation of the familiar
lotus design of Nilotic decorative art (<a href="#plate_XIX">Plate
XXIX. 2</a>).

On the tiny island of Mokhlos, only some 200 yards off the northern
coast of Crete, to which it was probably united in ancient days, Mr.
Seager has excavated, in 1907 and 1908, an Early Minoan necropolis,
from which have come some remarkable specimens of the skill with
which the ancient Cretan <a name="page_134"><span class="page">Page
134</span></a> workmen could handle both stone and the precious
metals. Scores of beautiful vases of alabaster, breccia, marble,
and soapstone, wrought in some cases to the thinness of a modern
china cup, suggest at once the protodynastic Egyptian bowls of
diorite and syenite, and show that if the Cretan took the idea from
Egyptian models, he was not behind his master in the skill with
which he carried it out. Not less surprising is the work in gold,
which includes 'fine chains&mdash;as beautifully wrought as the best
Alexandrian fabrics of the beginning of our era&mdash;artificial
leaves and flowers, and (the distant anticipation, surely, of the
gold masks of the Mycen&aelig; graves) gold bands with engraved
and <i>repouss&eacute;</i> eyes for the protective blinding of
the dead.'[*][**]

<p class="indent">
Excavating outside the area of the palace at Knossos, Dr. Evans
opened, on a hill known as Zafer Papoura, about half a mile north
of the palace, a large number of Minoan tombs dating from the Third
Middle Minoan period onwards. They revealed a civilization still high,
though giving evidence of gradual decline in its later stages. The
earlier tombs provided, what had been singularly lacking at Knossos,
a number of fine specimens of the 'stirrup-' or 'false-necked' vase.
There was also a number of bronze vessels and weapons, including
swords, some of which were nearly a metre in length. In one tomb,
which had evidently belonged to a chieftain, there was found a
short <a name="page_135"><span class="page">Page 135</span></a>
sword of elaborate workmanship, with a pommel of translucent agate,
and a gold-plated hilt, on which was engraved a scene of a lion
chasing and capturing one of the Cretan wild-goats. The occurrence
in some of the tombs of a long rapier and a shorter sword or dagger
is unexpected, as there are no representations of the two weapons
being worn together in Minoan warfare. Mr. Andrew Lang has made
the picturesque suggestion that we may have here an anticipation
of the duelling custom of the Elizabethan age, in which the dagger
was held in the left hand, and used for parrying thrusts, or for
work at close quarters, as in the savage encounter between Sir
Hatton Cheek and Sir Thomas Dutton at Calais in 1610.
</p>

<p class="indent">
On the hill of Isopata, between Knossos and the sea, Dr. Evans
also discovered a stately sepulchre, whose occupant had evidently
been some Minoan King of the Third Middle period. The tomb consisted
of a rectangular chamber measuring about 8 by 6 metres, and built
of courses of limestone blocks, which projected one beyond the
other until they met in a high gable, forming a false arch similar
to those of the beehive tombs at Mycen&aelig;. The back wall of
the chamber had a central cell opposite to its blocked entrance,
and the portal, also false-arched, led into a lofty entrance-hall,
in the side walls of which, facing one another, were two cells,
which had been used for interments. The whole was approached by
an imposing avenue cut in the solid rock. The tomb had been rifled
in ancient days, but there still remained a golden hair-pin, <a
name="page_136"><span class="page">Page 136</span></a> parts of
two silver vessels, and a large bronze mirror; while among the
stone vessels found a diorite bowl again recalled the hard stone
vessels of the Early Egyptian dynasties.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The Dict&aelig;an Cave has already been mentioned as being peculiarly
associated with the legends about the birth of Zeus and his relationship
with Minos. Hesiod states that Rhea carried the new-born Zeus to
Lyttos, and thence to a cavern in Mount Aigaios, the north-west
peak of Dicte. Lucretius, Virgil, and Dionysius of Halicarnassus
all knew of a story in which the whole childhood of Zeus had been
passed in a cave on Dicte, and Dionysius assigns to the Dict&aelig;an
Cave that finding of the law by Minos which presents so curious a
parallel to the giving of the tables of the law to Moses on Mount
Sinai. Minos, he says, went down into the Sacred Cave, and reappeared
with the law, saying that it was from Zeus himself. And the last
legend, related by Lucian, places in the same cave that union of
Zeus with Europa from which Minos sprang. The Dict&aelig;an Cave,
then, is of special interest in connection with the origins of
the Minoan civilization, or, rather, with the fancies which later
minds wove around some of the sacred conceptions of the Minoan
civilization. It is a large double cavern, south-west of Psychro,
and some 500 feet above the latter place. Its exploration by Mr.
Hogarth revealed ample evidence of its early connection with the
cult of that divinity upon whom the Greeks foisted their own ideas
of Zeus.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_137"><span class="page">Page 137</span></a> A scarped
terrace overlooking the slope of the hill gives access to the shallow
upper grotto, in which were found the remains of an altar, and
close by a table of offerings, while the ground beneath the floor
of the cave yielded, in regular stratification, Kamares ware,
immediately above the virgin soil; then glazed ware, with cloudy
brown stripes on a creamy slip; then regular Mycen&aelig;an ware,
with the familiar marine and plant designs; and, uppermost, bronze.
The lower grotto has at first a sheer fall from the upper one,
then slopes away for some 200 feet to an icy pool surrounded with
a forest of stalagmites; and in this gloomy cavern the evidence
was manifest of an ancient cult of a divinity to whom the Double
Axe was sacred. There was a great mass of votive offerings of all
sorts&mdash;engraved gems, bronze statuettes (including a
Twenty-second-Dynasty figure of the Egyptian god Amen-Ra), and
an abundance of common rings, pins, brooches, and knives; but the
chief feature of the find was the Double Axe, of which numerous
specimens were found embedded in the stalagmites around the dark
pool at the foot of the cavern, some of them still retaining their
original shafts. It is evident that the cave on Dicte was the seat
of a very ancient worship, connected with that worship whose emblems
were the Double Axe Pillars in the Palace of Knossos, and that
this worship, as revealed by the character of the remains in the
grotto, goes back to the early days of the Minoan civilization.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Throughout all these explorations, covering a <a name="page_138"><span
class="page">Page 138</span></a> considerable portion of the island,
one common feature presents itself&mdash;a feature already noted
and commented on in connection with Knossos. Nowhere have we met
with anything in the remotest degree resembling the colossal citadel
walls which are the most striking feature of Mycen&aelig; and Tiryns.
Ph&aelig;stos and Hagia Triada are as devoid of fortification as
Knossos. Gournia and Palaikastro are open towns. Everything points
to the existence of a strong and peaceful rule, allowing the natural
bent of the island race to develop quietly and steadily during long
periods in those lines of work, alike useful and artistic, whose
remains excite our admiration to-day, and resting for generation
after generation on the sea-power which kept all enemies far from
the shores of the fortunate island and guarded the trade-routes
of the &AElig;gean.

CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="subtitle">CRETE AND EGYPT</p>

<p class="indent">
The question of the relationship between the Minoan civilization
and the other great civilizations of the ancient world, particularly
those of Babylonia and Egypt, is not only of great intrinsic interest,
but also of very considerable importance to the attempt at a
reconstruction of the outlines of Minoan history and chronology.
For it is only by means of synchronisms with the more or less
satisfactorily, established chronology of one or other of these
kingdoms that even the most approximate system of dating can be
arrived at for the various epochs of the great civilization which the
Cretan discoveries have revealed. Had it been possible to establish
synchronisms with both Babylonian and Egyptian chronology, the result
would not only have been satisfactory as regards our knowledge
of the Minoan periods, but might have proved to have a secondary
outcome of the very greatest importance in the settlement of the
acute controversy which at present rages round the chronology of
ancient Egypt from the earliest period down to the rise of the New
<a name="page_140"><span class="page">Page 140</span></a> Empire.
As it is, this has so far proved to be impossible by reason of the
absence from the chain of the Babylonian link.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It may be held as reasonably certain that for many centuries there
was no lack of intercourse and interchange of commodities and ideas
between Crete and Asia; indeed, it is beginning to be more and
more manifest that in that ancient world there was infinitely more
intercommunication between the different peoples than had been
suspected. Far from the prehistoric age being a time of stagnation,
it was rather a time of ceaseless movement. Perhaps the most striking
example of the distance across which communication could take place
in almost incredibly early times is afforded by the discovery on the
site of ancient Troy&mdash;the Second City, roughly contemporary
with Early Minoan III.&mdash;of a piece of white jade, a stone
peculiar to China. By what long and devious routes it had reached
the coast of Asia Minor who can say? Yet the fact of its occurrence
there proves the fact of communication.

<p class="indent">
Up to the present time it cannot be said that any object unquestionably
Mesopotamian has been found on any &AElig;gean site, nor any object
unquestionably &AElig;gean on a Mesopotamian one. But it has been
suggested that certain carved ivories found by Layard at Nimr&ucirc;d
in the Palace of Sennacherib show manifest traces of &AElig;gean
influence; and in Southern Syria, at all events&mdash;at Gezer,
Tell-es-Safi, and elsewhere&mdash;indisputably &AElig;gean pottery
<a name="page_141"><span class="page">Page 141</span></a> and weapons
have been discovered in sufficient quantity to show that there
was certainly communication between the Minoan civilization and
the shores of Asia. Intercourse is suggested also by the obvious
communities of religious conception existing between Crete and Asia.
In both places the divine spirit is believed to associate itself
with sacred pillars, such as the Double Axe pillars at Knossos;
in both it is personified as a Woman Goddess, the mother of all
life, to whom is added a son, who is also a consort; while the
emblems of the ancient cults&mdash;the guardian lions of the goddess
on the hill, the Double Axe, and the triple pillars with perching
doves&mdash;are property common to both Crete and Asia. This may not
point, however, to a continued intercourse, but only to community
at some early point of the history of both races.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Of actual traces of Mesopotamian influence singularly few are to
be found in Crete. Dr. Evans has shown the correspondence of a
purple gypsum weight found during the second season's excavations
at Knossos, with the light Babylonian talent, while the ingots of
bronze from Hagia Triada represent the same standard of weight.
It may be that the drainage system so highly developed at Knossos
and Hagia Triada found its first suggestion in the terra-cotta
drain-pipes discovered at Niffur by Hilprecht, though it is by no
means obvious that copying should be necessary in such a matter.
The clay tablets engraved with hieroglyphic and linear script suggest
at once the corresponding and universal use <a name="page_142"><span
class="page">Page 142</span></a> of the clay tablet for the cuneiform
script of Babylonia; and that is practically all that can be said
of any connection between the cultures of Crete and Mesopotamia.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The case is quite different, however, when we come to the relations
between Crete and the great civilization of the Nile Valley. In
this case there is, if not abundance, at all events a sufficiency
of evidence as to an intercourse which extended through practically
the whole duration of the Minoan Empire. For the Early Dynastic
period of Egyptian history the evidence is somewhat slight, and
the interpretation of it not always certain. When we come to the
Middle Kingdom of Egypt&mdash;a period contemporaneous with Middle
Minoan II. and III.&mdash;it becomes both more abundant and more
unquestionable in meaning; while with the New Empire (Eighteenth
Dynasty) and Late Minoan II. we reach absolutely firm ground, the
correspondence of art motives, and the actual proofs of intercourse,
especially on the Egyptian side, being indisputable. Our object,
then, in this chapter is to exhibit the evidence of the relationship
between Crete and Egypt, and to inquire to what conclusion it leads
us concerning the dates of the various periods of Minoan history.
</p>

<p class="indent">
For the earliest period we are left with somewhat scanty evidence.
Professor Petrie has found in some of the First Dynasty graves at Abydos
vases of black hand-burnished ware, which are very closely allied,
both inform and colour, to the primitive <a name="page_143"><span
class="page">Page 143</span></a> 'bucchero' discovered immediately
above the Neolithic deposit in the West Court at Knossos; and he
has suggested that, as the pottery is not Egyptian in style, it
may have been imported from Crete. On various sites in the palace
at Knossos there have been found stone vessels of diorite, syenite,
and liparite, exquisitely wrought. Now, such work is eminently
characteristic of the Early Egyptian Dynastic period, the artists of
that time taking a pride in turning out bowls of these intensely
hard stones, wrought sometimes to such a degree of fineness as to
be translucent. The chances are against these bowls having been
imported in later days, as the taste for them gradually died out
in Egypt, and 'no ancient nation had antiquarian tastes till the
time of the Sa&iuml;tes in Egypt and of the Romans still later.'
The stone vessels discovered by Mr. Seager at Mokhlos, though wrought
out of beautiful native materials, betray, according to Dr. Evans,
the strong influence of protodynastic Egyptian models. Coming down a
little farther, to Early Minoan III., there is evidence of Egyptian
influence in the fact that the ivory seals of this period seem
to derive their motives from the so-called 'button-seals' of the
Sixth Egyptian Dynasty. Mr. H. R. Hall believes that the derivation
was the other way about. 'It would seem very probable that this
decidedly foreign decoration motive was adopted by the Egyptians
from the &AElig;geans about the end of the Old Kingdom (=Early Minoan
III.), so that the Egyptian seal designs are copied from those of
the Cretan seal-stones, <a name="page_144"><span class="page">Page
144</span></a> rather than the reverse. Egyptian designs were very
ancient, and had the spiral been Egyptian, we should have found
it in the art of the Old Kingdom. It was a foreign importation,
and its place of origin is evident.'[*] Whether in this case the
Minoan borrowed from the Egyptian or the Egyptian from the Minoan
is, however, immaterial; either way the fact of intercourse is
established.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote *: Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Arch&aelig;ology,
vol. xxxi., part v., p. 222.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
We may assume, then, that, in all probability, there was intercourse
of some kind between Crete and Egypt as early as the time of the
First Egyptian Dynasty, and that by the time of the Sixth Dynasty,
which marks the close of the great period of the Old Kingdom in
Egypt&mdash;the period of the Pyramid Builders (Third to Sixth
Dynasty)&mdash;intercourse was common. In fact, it may be said
that, from the origin of both peoples, the likelihood is that they
were in contact. It is possible enough that both the Nilotic and
the Minoan civilization sprang from a common stock, and that the
Neolithic Cretans and the Neolithic Egyptians were alike members
of the same widespread Mediterranean race.

<p class="indent">
How was the connection between Crete and Egypt maintained at this
extremely early period? Professor Petrie believes that it was by
the natural and direct sea-route across the Mediterranean. The
representations of vessels painted on pre-dynastic Egyptian ware
show that the Neolithic Egyptians were familiar, to some extent,
with the building and <a name="page_145"><span class="page">Page
145</span></a> the use of ships, and Professor Petrie supposes
that galleys such as those represented were the ships by means
of which the Egyptians and Cretans maintained their intercourse.
Mr. Hall, on the other hand, maintains that this is impossible,
and that the boats of the pre-dynastic ware are merely small
river-craft, totally unfitted for seafaring work.[*] In his 'Oldest
Civilization of Greece' he roundly asserts 'that these boats were
the ships which plied between Crete and Egypt some 4,000 years
B.C. Nothing can ever prove'; and he therefore believes that the
communication was kept up by way of Cyprus and the Palestinian
coast. But the evidence either way is of so extremely slight a
character, and the delineations in question are so rude, that it
might as well be said that nothing can ever prove that these boats
were <i>not</i> the ships which plied between Crete and Egypt.
It does not seem obvious why the voyage between Crete and Egypt
should be impossible to navigators who could accomplish that between
Crete and Cyprus; and if communication were maintained by way of
Cyprus, it seems strange that that island should show practically
no trace of having been influenced by Minoan civilization until
a comparatively late date. 'It was not till the Cretan culture
had passed its zenith and was already decadent that it reached
Cyprus.'[**] That the Homeric Greeks were by no means daring navigators
does not necessarily <a name="page_146"><span class="page">Page
146</span></a> imply that an island race, whose whole tradition
throughout its history was of sea-power, should have been equally
timid. When it is remembered in what type of vessel the Northmen
risked the Atlantic passage, one would be slow to believe that
even in immediately post-Neolithic times the Cretans could not
have evolved a type of boat as adequate to the run between Crete
and the Nile mouths as the 'long serpents' were to face the Atlantic
rollers.

<p class="indent">
But however the case may stand with regard to the pre-dynastic
period, there can be no question that by the end of the Third Dynasty
even Egypt had developed a marine not inadequate to the requirements
of the Cretan passage. We know that Sneferu, the last King of the
Third Dynasty, sent a fleet of forty ships to the Syrian coast
for cedar-wood, and that in his reign a vessel was built of the
very respectable length of 170 feet. Coming farther down, we know
also that Sahura of the Fifth Dynasty sent a fleet down the Red
Sea as far as Punt or Somaliland. And if the Egyptians, by no means
a great seafaring race, were able to do such things at this period
of their history, surely an island race, whose sole pathway to the
outer world lay across the sea, would not be behind them. There can
scarcely be any question that, by the time of the Pyramid builders
at latest, Cretan galleys were making the voyage to the Nile mouths,
and unloading at the quays of Memphis, under the shadow of the
new Pyramids, their primitive wares, <a name="page_147"><span
class="page">Page 147</span></a> among them the rude, hand-burnished
black pottery, in return for which they carried back some of the
wonderful fabric of the Egyptian stone-workers.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But supposing that the connection between the primitive Minoan
civilization and the earliest Dynasties of Egypt is a thing established,
what does this enable us to assert as to the date to which we are to
ascribe the dawn of the earliest culture that can be called European?
Here, unfortunately, we are at once involved in a controversy in which
centuries are unconsidered trifles, and a millennium is no more
than a respectable, but by no means formidable, quantity. Egyptian
chronology may be regarded as practically settled from the beginning
of the Eighteenth Dynasty downwards. There is a general consent of
authority that Aahmes, the founder of that Dynasty, began to reign
about 1580 B.C., and the dates assigned by the various schools of
chronology to the subsequent Dynasties differ only by quantities so
small as to be practically negligible. But when we attempt to trace
the chronology upwards from 1580 B.C., the consent of authorities
immediately vanishes, and is replaced by a gulf of divergence which
there is no possibility of bridging. The great divergence occurs in
the well-known dark period of Egyptian history between the Twelfth
and the Eighteenth Dynasties, where monumental evidence is extremely
scanty, almost non-existent, and where historians have to grope
for facts with no better light to guide them than is afforded by
the History of Manetho, and the torn <a name="page_148"><span
class="page">Page 148</span></a> fragments of the Turin Papyrus.
The traditional dating used to place the end of the Twelfth Dynasty
somewhere around 2500 B.C., allowing thus some 900 odd years for the
intervening dynasties before the rise of the Eighteenth. The modern
German school, however, represented by Erman, Mahler, Meyer, and the
American, Professor Breasted, arguing from the astronomical evidence
of the Kahun Papyrus, cuts this allowance short by over 700 years,
allowing only 208 years for the great gap, and proposing to pack the
five Dynasties and the Hyksos domination into that time. Professor
Petrie, finally, accepting, like the German school, the astronomical
evidence of the Kahun Papyrus, interprets it differently, and pushes
back the dates by a complete cycle of 1,460 years, allowing 1,666
years for the gap between the Twelfth Dynasty and the Eighteenth.
Thus, even between the traditional and the German dating there is a
gulf of 700 years for all dates of the Twelfth Dynasty, while as
between the German dating and that of Professor Petrie the gulf
widens to over 1,400 years.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Into the question of which system of dating should be adopted it
is impossible to enter, though it may be said that if 1,666 years
seems a huge allowance for the five Dynasties, 208 years seems
almost incredibly small. The result is what concerns us here, and
we are faced with the fact that, while the traditional dating places
the First Egyptian Dynasty at about 4000 B.C., the German school
would bring it down to 3400 B.C., and Professor Petrie thrusts it
<a name="page_149"><span class="page">Page 149</span></a> back
to 5510 B.C. Dr. Evans, in provisionally assigning dates to the
periods of Minoan history, formerly drew nearer to the traditional
than to either the German dating or that of Professor Petrie; but
he has gradually modified this position, and now dates his Middle
Minoan II., which synchronizes with the Twelfth Egyptian Dynasty,
at 2000 B.C., thus practically accepting the chronology of the
German school. This would place Early Minoan I., which must be
equated with the First Dynasty, about 3400 B.C. Practically, all
that can be said with a moderate amount of certainty is that the
earliest civilization of Crete, like that of Egypt, was in existence
at a period not much later than 3500 B.C., while it is not impossible
that it may be 1,500 years older. Even accepting the lower figure, the
antiquity of man's first settlements on the hill of Kephala becomes
absolutely staggering to the mind. If the growth of deposit on the
hill was at the rate of something like 3 feet in a millennium&mdash;a
reasonable supposition&mdash;it follows that we must place the
earliest habitations of Neolithic man at Knossos not later than
10000, perhaps as early as 12000 B.C.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It is not till many centuries after the Sixth Egyptian Dynasty
had passed away that we come upon fresh evidence of the connection
between the two countries. The earlier palaces at Knossos and
Ph&aelig;stos had been built, and the first period of Middle Minoan,
with its beginnings of polychrome decoration and its Queen Elizabeth
figurines from Petsofa, had come and gone in Crete, while in <a
name="page_150"><span class="page">Page 150</span></a> Egypt the
corresponding period had been marked by the troublous times between
the Seventh and the Eleventh Dynasties. But the rise of the Twelfth
Dynasty in Egypt marked the beginning of a more stable state of
affairs in the Nile Valley, and in this period, which corresponds
with Dr. Evans's Middle Minoan II., there are again evidences of
touch between the two kingdoms. With regard to absolute dating, we
are of course as much in the dark as ever, and may choose between
2000, 2500, and 3459 B.C. In any case, at this point, put it
provisionally at 2000 B.C., the Egypt of the Senuserts and Amenemhats
and the Crete of Middle Minoan II. are manifestly contemporaneous,
and in well-established connection. In Crete this was the period
when the beautiful polychrome Kamares ware was at the height of
its popularity, and at Kahun, close to the pyramid of Senusert
II., Professor Petrie some years ago discovered some unquestionable
specimens of this fine ware, which had certainly been imported from
Crete, as the fabric is one quite unknown to native Egyptian ceramic
art. Even more conclusive was Professor Garstang's discovery, in an
untouched tomb at Abydos, of a polychrome vessel in the latest
style of the period, in company with glazed steatite cylinders,
which bear the names of Senusert III. and Amenemhat III., the last
great Kings of the Twelfth Dynasty.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But the most interesting link between the two countries is found
in the fact that in this period there was erected in Egypt the
building which came to be <a name="page_151"><span class="page">Page
151</span></a> looked on as the parallel to the Cretan Labyrinth,
and which, with a curious inversion of the actual facts, was long
supposed to be the original from which the Cretan Labyrinth was
derived. The pyramid of Amenemhat III., the greatest King of the
great Twelfth Dynasty, and indeed one of the greatest men who ever
held the Egyptian sceptre, stood at Hawara, near the mouth of the
Fayum. Not far from it Amenemhat erected a huge temple, such as
had never been built before, and never was built again, even in
that land of gigantic structures. The great building was erected,
in a taste eminently characteristic of the Middle Kingdom, of great
blocks of fine limestone and crystalline quartzite. It has long
since disappeared, having been used as a quarry for thousands of
years; but the size of the site, which can still be traced, shows
that in actual area the temple covered a space of ground within
which Karnak, Luqsor, and the Ramesseum, huge as they all are,
could quite well have stood together.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Even in the time of Herodotus enough was still remaining of this
vast building to excite his profound wonder and admiration, and it
seemed to him a more remarkable structure than even the Pyramids. 'It
has,' he says, 'twelve courts enclosed with walls, with doors opposite
each other, six facing the north, and six the south, contiguous to
one another, and the same exterior wall encloses them. It contains
two kinds of rooms, some under ground, and some above ground over
them, to the number of 3,000, 1,500 of each.' He was not allowed to
inspect the underground <a name="page_152"><span class="page">Page
152</span></a> chambers. 'But the upper ones, which surpass all
human works, I myself saw; for the passages through the corridors,
and the windings through the courts, from their great variety,
presented a thousand occasions of wonder as I passed from a court
to the rooms, and from the rooms to halls, and to other corridors
from the halls, and to other courts from the rooms. The roofs of
all these are of stone, as also are the walls; but the walls are
full of sculptured figures. Each court is surrounded with a colonnade
of white stone, closely fitted.'[*] Herodotus believed that the
building belonged to the time of Psamtek I., in which, of course,
he was ludicrously far astray, but otherwise there seems no reason
to question that his description actually represents what he saw,
though no doubt his lively mind somewhat multiplied the number
of the rooms.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote *: Herodotus II. 148.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Pliny the elder, judging from his description, evidently saw much
the same thing at Hawara as Herodotus had seen, though time must
have somewhat diminished the splendour of the building. Now, to this
temple there was already applied in the time of Herodotus the name
Labyrinth. It used to be believed that the Hawara Labyrinth gave its
name to the Cretan one, and an Egyptian etymology was arranged for
the word 'labyrinth,' according to which it would have meant 'the
temple at the mouth of the canal.' The Egyptian form of the title,
however, is 'a mere figment of the philological imagination.' Probably
originality lies in the <a name="page_153"><span class="page">Page
153</span></a> other direction. The first palace at Knossos dates
from a period certainly as early as, probably somewhat earlier
than, the Hawara temple; and since the derivation of the word
'labyrinth' from the Labrys or Double Axe, making the palace the
House or Place of the Double Axe, seems quite satisfactory, the
Egyptian Labyrinth in all likelihood derived its name from the
House of Minos at Knossos. Apart, however, from any mere question
of names, there appears the interesting parallel that the two most
famous Labyrinths, the first palace at Knossos, and the great Hawara
temple, actually belong to the same period&mdash;a period when,
as we know from the other evidence, there was certainly active
intercourse between the two nations.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Mr. Hall has pointed out[*] the resemblance between the actual
building at Knossos and the descriptions left to us of its Egyptian
contemporary. The literary tradition of the Labyrinth of Minos
is that it was a place of mazy passages and windings, difficult
to traverse without a guide or clue, and the actual remains at
Knossos show that the palace must have answered very well to such
a description, while the feature of the Hawara temple which struck
both Herodotus and Pliny was precisely the same. 'The passages
through the corridors and the windings through the courts, from
their great variety, presented a thousand occasions of wonder.'
The resemblance extended to the material of which the buildings
were erected. The fine white limestone <a name="page_154"><span
class="page">Page 154</span></a> of Hawara must have closely resembled
the shining white gypsum of Knossos, and though the Egyptian Labyrinth
has passed away too completely for us to be able to judge of its
masonry, yet the splendid building work of the Eleventh Dynasty
temple of Mentuhotep Neb-hapet-Ra at Deir-el-Bahri, with its great
blocks of limestone beautifully fitted and laid, affords a good
Middle Kingdom parallel to the great gypsum blocks of the Knossian
palace. Of course we cannot attribute to Cretan influence the style
of the Egyptian building in this respect. For hundreds of years the
Egyptians had been past masters in the art of great construction
with huge blocks of stone, so that, if there is to be any derivation
on this point, it may rather have been Crete which followed the
example of Egypt. But it may not be altogether a mere coincidence
that, in a period of Egyptian history which we know to have been
linked with an important epoch of Cretan development, there should
have been erected in Egypt a building absolutely unparalleled, so
far as we know, among the architectural triumphs of that nation,
but bearing no distant resemblance, if the descriptions are to be
trusted, to the great palace which the Minoan Sovereigns had newly
reared, or were, perhaps, still rearing, for themselves at Knossos.
Is it permissible to fancy that the envoys of Amenemhat III. may
have brought back to Egypt reports and descriptions of the great
Cretan palace which may have fired that King with the desire to
leave behind him a memorial, unique among Egyptian buildings, but
<a name="page_155"><span class="page">Page 155</span></a> inspired
by the actual achievements of his brother monarchs in Crete? Whether
the idea of this relation between the two buildings be merely fanciful
or not, their resemblances add another illustration to the proofs of
the close connection between the Minoan and the Egyptian cultures
in the third millennium B.C.
</p>

<p class="footnote">

<p class="indent">
With the succeeding Cretan epoch, Middle Minoan III., we come into
touch with the dark age of Egyptian history, the great gap covering
Dynasties XIII.-XVII., towards the close of which is to be placed
the Hyksos domination. As the age was so troubled in Egypt, it
is scarcely probable that we shall find much evidence there of
any connection between the two lands; but the evidence found on
Cretan soil, though slight, is conclusive as to the fact that
communication was maintained. For the earlier part of the period
we have the statuette, already mentioned as having been found at
Knossos, bearing the name of 'Ab-nub's child, Sebek-user, deceased,
born of the lady Sat-Hathor.' 'Who Sebek-user was,' as Mr. Hall
remarks, 'and how his statuette got to Crete, we have no means
of knowing.' But the 'deceased' in the inscription shows that the
statuette was a funerary or memorial one, and it is hardly likely
that such an object was imported merely for its own sake or for
its artistic value, which is slight enough. May it not be that
either Ab-nub, the father, or Sebek-user, the son, or both, may
have been Egyptians resident at the Court of Knossos, either <a
name="page_156"><span class="page">Page 156</span></a> as
representatives of Egyptian interests or as skilled artificers,
and that the statuette is the memorial of one who died far from
his native land, but not without friends to see that he did not
lack the funerary attentions which would have been his at home? No
doubt there was interchange of persons as well as of commodities
between the two lands; some of the artists and craftsmen of both
countries would naturally go to where there was a demand arising
for their work, or where instructors were being sought to teach
the new arts; and Ab-nub and his son Sebek-user may have drifted
to Knossos in this manner, and found at last their graves there.
Were they conceivably responsible for the 'imported alabaster vases
dating from the Middle Kingdom of Egypt,' which were found in the
royal tomb at Isopata?
</p>

<p class="indent">
Towards the close of this epoch the ceramic art of Knossos shows
features which are directly attributable to Egyptian influence.
The art of glazing pottery was not a native Cretan, but an Egyptian
art; it is in full use in Egypt from the very beginnings of the
First Dynasty. But now we find it appearing in a high state of
development in Crete in the beautiful fa&iuml;ence reliefs of the
wild-goat and kids, the vases with the wild-rose in relief on the
lip, and the figurines of the Snake Goddess and her votaresses.
The Cretan artists, however, though they borrowed the process,
adapted it to their own tastes. In Egypt the native fa&iuml;ence
of the time is of strictly conventional type, with black design
on <a name="page_157"><span class="page">Page 157</span></a> blue;
but the Cretan emancipated himself from these limits, and made his
fa&iuml;ence reliefs in the polychrome style, which still persisted,
though now no longer so prevalent as it had once been.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The disastrous period of the Hyksos domination in Egypt has left
but one trace at Knossos, but that is of peculiar interest, for
it is the lid of an alabastron bearing the name of the Hyksos King
Khyan. It cannot be said that we know any of the Hyksos Kings,
but Khyan is the one whose relics are the most widely distributed
and have the most interest. The finding of the lid at Knossos, his
farthest west, is balanced by the lion, bearing his cartouche,
found many years ago at Baghdad, his farthest east, while in his
inscriptions he calls himself 'Embracer of territories.' So it
has been suggested that the Knossos lid and the Baghdad lion are
the scanty relics of a great Hyksos empire which once extended
from the Euphrates to the First Cataract of the Nile, and possibly
also held Crete in subjection. In all likelihood, however, the
idea is merely a dream; certainly so far as regards Crete it is
most improbable. In the palmiest days of the Egyptian navy the
Pharaohs never held any dominion over Crete, and even Cyprus was
never really under their rule. It is much less likely still that a
King of the Hyksos race, whose whole tradition is of the land and
the desert, should have succeeded in establishing any suzerainty
over a race whose whole tradition is of the sea, and which was
then in the full pride of its strength.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_158"><span class="page">Page 158</span></a> Another
era of history has passed away before we again find Crete and Egypt
in close touch with one another. In Crete the last period of Middle
Minoan had been succeeded by the first of Late Minoan, in which the
great palace of the Middle period was being gradually transformed
into a still larger and more magnificent structure, which was not to
be completed until the succeeding period. In Egypt the Seventeenth
Dynasty had at last, after long hesitation, picked up the gauntlet
thrown down by the Hyksos conquerors, and the War of Independence
had resulted in the expulsion of the Desert Princes and their race.
The conquering Dynasty had been succeeded by the Eighteenth, the
Dynasty of Queen Hatshepsut, Tahutmes III., and Amenhotep III.,
and Egypt was in the full tide of a great revival, alike in
world-influence, in trade, and in art. Queen Hatshepsut, who states
in one of her inscriptions that 'her spirits inclined towards foreign
peoples,' had sent out her squadron to Somaliland, and Tahutmes
III. had organized a war-fleet on the Mediterranean coast-line. The
ancient Empire of the Nile was opening its arms in every direction
to outside influences, and was drawing into the ports of the great
river the commercial and artistic products of every known people.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Among the races who are most prominent in the Egyptian records
of the period are the Keftiu, who are frequently represented in
the paintings of the time, and always with the same characteristic
features, the same dress and bearing, the same <a name="page_159"><span
class="page">Page 159</span></a> products of commerce and art. Who,
then, were the Keftiu? The word means the people or the country 'at
the back of'&mdash;in other words, at the back of 'the Very Green,'
as the Egyptians called the Mediterranean. So that the Keftians with
whom the merchants and courtiers of Egypt grew familiar in the
times of Hatshepsut and Tahutmes III. Were to them the men 'from
the back of beyond'&mdash;the farthest distant people with whom they
had any dealings. But what race could correspond to these 'back of
beyond' men? In Ptolemaic times the word 'Keftiu' was unquestionably
applied to the Ph&oelig;nicians, who had for long been the great seafarers
and carriers of the Mediterranean; and till recent years it was
generally believed that the Keftiu of the Eighteenth Dynasty were
Ph&oelig;nicians also, though their faces, as depicted on the Egyptian
wall-paintings, did not bear the slightest trace of Semitic cast.
But the discoveries of the last few years have demolished that
idea for ever, along with many other beliefs as to the influence of
the overrated Ph&oelig;nicians upon the culture of the Mediterranean
area, and the pictures of the Minoans of Knossos have made it certain
that the Keftiu of the Eighteenth Dynasty were none others than
the ambassadors, sailors, and merchants of the Sea-Kings of Crete.
Fortunately, the tomb-painting which has preserved so many interesting
details of Egyptian life, was never more assiduously practised
or more happily inspired than at this period. In all the chief
tombs there are pictured processions of Northerners, <a
name="page_160"><span class="page">Page 160</span></a> Westerners,
Easterners, and Southerners, the North being represented by Semites,
the East by the men of Punt, the South by negroes, and the West
by the Keftiu; and we can compare the men of the Knossos frescoes
with their fellow-countrymen as depicted on the tomb-walls of the
Theban grandees, and be certain that, allowing for the differences
in the style of art, they are essentially the same people. The
tombs which preserve best the figures of the Keftiu are those of
Sen-mut and Rekh-ma-ra. That of Sen-mut is the earlier, though
only by a generation, or perhaps rather less. He was the architect
of Queen Hatshepsut, the man who planned and executed the great
colonnaded temple at Deir-el-Bahri, and who set up Hatshepsut's
gigantic obelisks. His tomb at Thebes overlooks the temple which
he built at his Queen's command to be 'a paradise for Amen,' and
on its walls we can see 'the men from the back of beyond' walking
in procession, each with his offering to present to the Pharaoh.
There can be no question as to who they are. The half-boots and
puttees, the decorated girdle compressing the waist, not quite
so tightly as in the Minoan representations, the gaily adorned
loin-cloth, which is the only article of attire, all are practically
identical with the type of such a fresco as that of the Cupbearer
at Knossos. The conscientious Egyptian artists have carefully
represented also the elaborate coiffure which was characteristic of
the Minoans, who allowed their hair to fall in long tails down their
shoulders, doing part of it up in a knot <a name="page_161"><span
class="page">Page 161</span></a> or curl on the top of the head.
The tribute-bearers carry in their hands or upon their shoulders
great vessels of gold and silver, some of them exactly resembling
in shape the Vaphio cups, though much larger than these, some of
them of the type of the bronze ewer found in the north-west house
at Knossos.

Rekh-ma-ra, in whose tomb are the other notable pictures of the
Keftiu, was also a great figure in Egyptian history in the next
reign. He was Vizier to Tahutmes III., the conquering Pharaoh of
the Eighteenth Dynasty. The pictures on the walls of his tomb are,
at least in some cases, evidently more than mere racial studies;
they are careful portraits. 'The first man, "The Great Chief of
the Kefti, and the Isles of the Green Sea," is young, and has a
remarkably small mouth with an amiable expression. His complexion is
fair rather than dark, but his hair is dark brown. His lieutenant,
the next in order, is of a different type&mdash;elderly, with a
most forbidding visage, Roman nose, and nut-cracker jaws. Most of
the others are very much alike&mdash;young, dark in complexion,
and with long black hair hanging below their waists and twisted
up into fantastic knots and curls on the tops of their heads.'[*]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote *: H. R. Hall, 'Egypt and Western Asia,' p. 362.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
These Keftiu, then, were the Minoans of the Great Palace period of
Crete, the pre-Hellenic Greeks, the Pelasgi of old Greek tradition,
in whose time the great civilization of the Minoan Empire reached its
culminating point, and was within a little <a name="page_162"><span
class="page">Page 162</span></a> of its final disaster. It is a
fortunate circumstance that Sen-mut and Rekh-ma-ra should have
caused them to be portrayed when they did, for in two or three
generations more the glory of Knossos had passed away, never to be
revived. Greece gave to Egyptian scholars the key to the translation
of the hieroglyphics in the Greek version of the Egyptian text on
the Rosetta Stone; the paintings of the Theban tombs have paid
back an instalment of that debt in showing us the likenesses of
those 'Greeks before the Greeks' who dwelt in Crete. Perhaps some
day the debt will be fully repaid by the discovery of a bilingual
text in Egyptian and Minoan, giving us in hieroglyphics a version
of some passage of that Minoan script which now exists only to
tantalize us with records of an ancient history which we cannot read.
Such a discovery is by no means beyond the bounds of possibility.
It is not so long since Boghaz-Keui supplied us with a cuneiform
version of the famous treaty between the Egyptians and the Hittites
in the time of Ramses II.; perhaps some site in Crete or Egypt
may yet provide us with a bilingual treaty between Tahutmes III.
and the Minoan Sovereign of his time.
</p>

<p class="indent">
After the time of Tahutmes, the evidences of connection between the
two lands grow scanty once more. The fact that the fa&iuml;ence of
the time of Amenhotep III. has discarded the old Egyptian tradition
of black upon blue, and now rejoices in splendid chocolates, purples,
violets, reds, and apple-greens, shows that Cretan influence was still
strong. <a name="page_163"><span class="page">Page 163</span></a>
Fragments of Late Minoan pottery found in abundance on the site of
Akhenaten's new capital at Tell-el-Amarna show that even in the
reign of this King, the heretic son and successor of Amenhotep
III., Crete was still trading with Egypt. But before Akhenaten
came to the throne, about 1380 B.C.&mdash;possibly twenty years
before that event&mdash;the great catastrophe which brought the
Minoan Empire of Knossos to a close had already happened. The Cretan
wares which filtered into Egypt after 1400 B.C. were the products
of the Minoan decadence, when the survivors of the Empire of the
Sea-Kings&mdash;a broken and dwindling race&mdash;were still trying
to maintain a slowly failing tradition of art under the new masters,
perhaps the Mycen&aelig;ans of the mainland, who, driven forth
themselves by the pressure of Northern invaders, had crushed in
their turn the gentler sister civilization of Crete.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The Mycen&aelig;an 'stirrup-vases' pictured in the tomb of Ramses
III. (1202-1170 B.C.), and the representations in the tomb of Imadua
of gold cups of the Vaphio type, carry the connection down to the last
dregs of the dying' race; but by the time of Ramses III. the Minoan
kingdom had probably been dead and buried for about two centuries.
In fact, with the rise of the Nineteenth Dynasty in Egypt (1350
B.C.), the name of the Keftiu disappears from the Egyptian records,
and in the place of the men from the back of beyond there appears
a confused jumble of warring sea-tribes, some of them possibly the
men who had overthrown the <a name="page_164"><span class="page">Page
164</span></a> Minoan Empire, some of them probably representing
the broken fragments of that Empire itself, who unite in attacks
upon Egypt, but are foiled and overthrown. In the record of the
earlier of these invasions, that which took place in the reign
of Merenptah (1234-1214 B.C.), the successor of Ramses II., it
is difficult to trace any names that have Cretan connections. The
Aqayuasha may conceivably have been Ach&aelig;ans; but that is
another story.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But when we come to deal with the great invasion in the reign of
Ramses III., about 1200 B.C., we get into touch with tribes which
bear almost beyond question the marks of Cretan origin, and one of
which is particularly interesting to us on other grounds. In the
eighth year of Ramses III. The eastern coasts of the Mediterranean
were swept by a great invasion of the 'Peoples of the Sea.' 'The
isles were restless, disturbed among themselves,' says Ramses in
his inscription at Medinet Habu. Very probably the incursion was the
result of the southward movement of the invading northern tribes,
whose pressure was forcing the ancient &AElig;gean peoples to migrate
and seek new homes for themselves. Landing in Northern Syria, the
sea-peoples quickly made themselves masters of the fragments of
the once formidable Hittite confederacy, and, absorbing in their
alliance the Hittites, who may indeed have been of their own kin,
they moved southwards along the sea-coast, their fleet of war-galleys
keeping pace with the advance of the land <a name="page_165"><span
class="page">Page 165</span></a> army. They established a central
camp and place of arms in the land of Amor, or of the Amorites, and
their southward movement speedily became a menace to the Egyptian
Empire. Ramses III., the last great soldier of the true Egyptian
stock, made effective preparations to meet them. Gathering at the
Nile mouths a numerous fleet, which carried large numbers of the
dreaded Egyptian archers, he advanced with the land army to meet
the invaders, his fleet also accompanying the march of the army.
The locality of the encounter between the two forces is doubtful,
some placing it in Ph&oelig;nicia, and others much nearer to the Egyptian
frontier. In any case, a great battle was fought, both by land
and sea, and the Egyptian army and fleet were entirely successful
in the double encounter. The reliefs of Ramses at Medinet Habu
show the details of the battle, the Egyptian fleet penetrating
and overthrowing that of the sea-peoples, while the Pharaoh from
the shore assists by archery in the discomfiture of his enemies.
The result of the double victory was to put an effective check
on any aspirations which the invaders may have cherished in the
direction of a permanent occupation of Egypt, though quite probably
they continued to hold the territory they had already gained.

</div>

<p class="indent">
The tribes which are mentioned in the inscriptions of Ramses as
having been leagued together in this attempt are the Danauna, the
Uashasha, the Zakkaru, the Shakalsha, and the Pulosathu, in alliance
with the North Syrian tribes. The Danauna <a name="page_166"><span
class="page">Page 166</span></a> are evidently the Danaoi, or Argives,
the same race which, under Ach&aelig;an overlords, composed the mass
of the Greek army at the siege of Troy. As Danaos, the name-hero
of the race, was King of Rhodes and Argos, these sea-Danaoi may have
been Rhodian Argives. The Shakalsha are a more doubtful quantity,
having been variously identified with the Sikels of ancient Sicily
and with the Sagalassians of Pisidia. But the remaining tribes are
in all probability Cretans, fragments of the old Minoan Empire
which had collapsed two centuries before, and was now gradually
becoming disintegrated under the continued pressure from the north.
The Zakkaru have been connected by Professor Petrie with the coast-town
of Zakro, in Eastern Crete, and the identification, though not
absolutely certain, is at all events very probable. The Uashasha
have been associated by Mr. H. R. Hall with the town of Axos, in
Crete. There remain the Pulosathu, who are, almost beyond question,
the Philistines, so well known to us from their connection with
the rise of the Hebrew monarchy. The Hebrew tradition brought the
Philistines from Kaphtor, and Kaphtor is plainly nothing else than
the Egyptian Kefti, or Keftiu. In the Philistines, then, we have the
last organized remnant of the old Minoan sea-power. Thrown back from
the frontier of Egypt by the victory of Ramses III., they established
themselves on the maritime plain of Palestine, where perhaps the
Minoans had already occupied trading-settlements, and there formed
a community consisting of <a name="page_167"><span class="page">Page
167</span></a> five cities, governed by five confederate tyrants.
No doubt they brought under and held in subjection the ancient
Canaanite population of the district, whom they would rule as the
Normans ruled the inhabitants of Sicily. In the district which
they governed, and especially at Tell-es-Safi (Gath), Messrs. Bliss
and Macalister have discovered many specimens of pottery which
is obviously Cretan of the Third Late Minoan period, together with
ware which is local in the sense of having been manufactured on
the spot, but is quite certainly Late Minoan also in its design
and decoration.
</p>

<p class="indent">
So, then, the nation with which we have all been familiar from the
earliest days of childhood as the hated rival of the young Hebrew
state, whose wars with the Hebrews are the subject of so many of
the heroic stories of Israel's Iron Age, was the last survival of
the great race of Minos. Samson made sport for his Cretan captors
in a Minoan Theatral Area by the portico of some degenerate House
of Minos, half palace, half shrine, with Cretan ladies in their
strangely modern garb of frills and flounces looking down from
the balconies to see his feats of strength, as their ancestresses
had looked down at Knossos on the boxing and bull-grappling of the
palmy days when Knossos ruled the &AElig;gean. The great champion
whom David met and slew in the vale of Elah was a Cretan, a Pelasgian,
one of the Greeks before the Greeks, wearing the bronze panoply with
the feather-crested helmet which his people had adopted in their
later days in place of <a name="page_168"><span class="page">Page
168</span></a> the old leathern cap and huge figure-eight shield.
Ittai of Gath, David's faithful captain of the bodyguard, and David's
body-guards themselves, the Cherethites and Pelethites (Cretans
and Philistines), were all of the same race.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Though these last supporters of the great Minoan tradition had
fallen upon evil times, it is evident that they were not altogether
degenerate. The references to their cities in Scripture show that
they still retained the national taste for splendid buildings;
and no doubt their culture, though belonging to the last and most
debased period of Minoan art, was far in advance of that of the
rude Hebrew tribes. The golden mice and tumours which they sent to
the Hebrews along with the ark of Jehovah recall on the one hand
the skill of the Minoan goldsmiths, and on the other the votive
images of animals and diseased human organs placed in the old shrine
at Petsofa. The respect which was excited by their warlike prowess
can easily be read between the lines of the Hebrew story. A race
that to its opponents appears to breed giants is a race that has
proved itself thoroughly respectable on the field of war; and the
fact that a small league of five towns maintained itself so long as
it did, and was able to make itself so dreaded, points to bravery
and skill in arms altogether out of proportion to its actual strength
in mere numbers. Evidently the last Minoans succeeded in creating
an atmosphere for themselves in Palestine, and in impressing the
surrounding peoples with a wholesome terror of them. We may imagine
<a name="page_169"><span class="page">Page 169</span></a> the men
from Crete, lithe and agile, as we see them on the Boxer Vase of
Hagia Triada, swaggering in their bronze armour among the weaker
Orientals, much as the later Greek hoplite of the times of Psamtek
I. or Haa-ab-ra domineered over the native Egyptians.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But all the same the Philistine was an anachronism, a survival from
an older world. The day of the Minoan, like that of his early friend
the Egyptian, had passed away. The stars of new races were rising
above the horizon, and new claimants were dividing the heritage of
the ancient world. To the new Greek the realm of knowledge and
art which his Cretan forerunner had not unworthily cultivated; to
the Mesopotamian the realm of armed dominance, to which also the
Cretan had once laid claim; to the Hebrew the realm of spiritual
thought, in which, by reason of our ignorance, we can say next to
nothing of the Cretan's achievement, save only that he too sought
for God, if haply he might feel after Him and find Him.

CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="subtitle">THE DESTROYERS</p>

<p class="indent">
The Empire of the Sea-Kings had not been immune from disaster and
defeat any more than any other great Empire of the ancient world.
The times of conquest and triumph, when Knossos exacted its human
tribute from the vanquished states, Megara or Athens, or from its
own far-spread dependencies, had occasionally been broken by periods
when victory left its banners, and when the indignities it had
inflicted on other states were retaliated on itself. Once at least
in the long history of the palace at Knossos, if not twice, there
had come a disastrous day when the Minoan fleet had either been
defeated or eluded, when some invading force had landed and swept
up the valley, had overcome what resistance could be made by the
guard of the unfortified palace, and had ebbed back again to its
ships, leaving death and fire-blackened walls behind it. The Second
Middle Minoan period closes with the evidence of such a general
catastrophe, in which the palace was sacked and fired, and there
are also traces which suggest that <a name="page_171"><span
class="page">Page 171</span></a> the end of the preceding period
was marked by a similar disaster.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But these catastrophes, whether the agents of them were mere sea-rovers,
making a daring raid upon the eyrie of the great sea-power, or
the warriors of rival mainland states, eager to avenge upon their
enemy what they themselves had suffered at her hands, or, as Dr.
Evans and other explorers incline rather to believe, Cretans from
Ph&aelig;stos, whose purpose was merely to overthrow the ruling
dynasty, scarcely interrupted the current of Minoan development. If
the enemy came from without, he came only to destroy and plunder,
not to occupy, and, having done his work, departed; if from within
the Empire, his triumph made no breach in the continuity of the
Minoan tradition. The palace rose again from its ashes, greater
and more glorious than before, and men of the same stock carried
on the work that had been checked for a while by the rough hand of
war. The men of the Third Middle Minoan period reared the beginnings
of the second palace on the site where the first had stood, and in
the relics of their arts and crafts the same spirit which informed
the earlier period still prevails, with no greater modifications
than such as come naturally to the art of any nation by the mere
lapse of time.
</p>

<p class="indent">
From the beginning of Middle Minoan III. to the end of Late Minoan
II.&mdash;a period, that is to say, of either some 500 or almost
2,000 years, according to the scheme of Egyptian chronology which
we may adopt&mdash;the civilization of Crete apparently followed
<a name="page_172"><span class="page">Page 172</span></a> a course
of even and peaceful development. At Knossos, Ph&aelig;stos, and
Hagia Triada the great palaces slowly grew to their final glory.
The art that had produced the beautiful polychrome Kamares ware
passed away, and was succeeded by the naturalism which has left us
the Blue Boy who gathers the white crocuses, and the fa&iuml;ence
reliefs of the Temple Repositories, a naturalism which, with various
modifications in style and material, persists to the end of Late
Minoan I. In the midst of this period (Late Minoan I.) come what
are perhaps the highest developments of Minoan art in the shape of
the steatite vases of Hagia Triada, Boxer, Harvester, and Chieftain.
On the mainland the kindred culture of Mycen&aelig; was rising to
its culmination, and the art represented in the Circle-Graves was
almost in the fulness of its bloom. Naturalism declines in its
turn, and is succeeded by the Later Palace style, more grandiose,
more mannered, and less free than that which had preceded it. It
was in the Later Palace period (Late Minoan II.) that the miniature
frescoes were painted, to preserve for us the strangely modern
style of the Minoan Court, with its flounced and furbelowed dames.
Naturalism, though failing, was still capable of great things, and
its last efforts in the palace at Knossos gave us the magnificent
reliefs of painted stucco, such as the bull's head and the King with
the peacock plumes. Over the seas, the Egyptians of the Eighteenth
Dynasty were setting down on their tomb walls those likenesses
of the Keftiu which have helped us <a name="page_173"><span
class="page">Page 173</span></a> to the date of this last development
of Minoan greatness.

<p class="indent">
Probably the power and grandeur of the Empire was never more imposing
than during the hundred years before 1400 B.C. The House of Minos
at Knossos had reached its full development, and stood in all its
splendour, an imposing mass of building, crowning the hill of Kephala
with its five storeys around the great Central. Court, its Theatral
Area, and its outlying dependencies. Within its spacious porticoes and
corridors the walls glowed with the brilliant colours of innumerable
frescoes and reliefs in coloured plaster. The Cup-Bearer, the Queen's
Procession, the Miniature Frescoes of the Palace Sports, stood out in
all their freshness. Magnificent urns in painted pottery, with reliefs
like those of the great papyrus vase (<a href="#plate_XXIII">Plate
XXIII.</a>), decorated the halls and courts, and were rivalled by
huge stone amphor&aelig;, exquisitely carved. The King and his
courtiers were served in costly vessels of gold, silver, and bronze
<i>repouss&eacute;</i> work. The Empire of the Sea-Kings was at
its apogee, and on every hand there were the evidences of security
and luxury.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But, as in the contemporary Egypt of Amenhotep III. a similar
development in all the comforts and luxuries of civilized life
was swiftly followed by the downfall under Akhenaten, so in Crete
the luxury of Late Minoan II. was only the prelude to its great and
final disaster. Exactly when the catastrophe came we cannot tell.
The Cretan Empire was certainly still existent in all its glory
in 1449 <a name="page_174"><span class="page">Page 174</span></a>
B.C., when Amenhotep II., the son of the great Tahutmes III., came
to the throne, for Rekh-ma-ra, the Vizier of Tahutmes, in whose
tomb the visit of the Keftian ambassadors is pictured, survived,
as we know, into the reign of Amenhotep. The twenty-six years of
Amenhotep II.'s reign, and the almost nine of Tahutmes IV., bring
us to the accession of Amenhotep III. in 1414, and the thirty-six
years of the latter take us to 1379 B.C. or thereby, when the heretic
Akhenaten, whose reign was to witness the downfall of the Egyptian
Empire in Syria, ascended the throne. Somewhere within these seventy
years the Empire of the Minoans passed away in fire and bloodshed,
and we shall probably not go far wrong if we suppose that the great
catastrophe came about the year 1400 B.C. The conclusion of Dr.
Evans is that 'it seems reasonable to suppose that the overthrow
at Knossos had taken place not later than the first half of the
fourteenth century.'[*] Mrs. H. B. Hawes places the fall of Knossos
at 1450; but Rekh-ma-ra must have still been living at that date,
and, as Professor Burrows remarks, 'it would at least be a strange
coincidence if Egyptian artists were painting the glories of the
Palace at the very moment when they were passing away.'
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote *: 'Scripta Minoa,' pp. 52, 53.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
That there was a huge disaster, which broke for ever the power of
the Sea-Kings, is unmistakable. The Minoan kingdom did not fall from
over-ripeness and decay, as was the case with so many other empires.
The latest relics of its art before the <a name="page_175"><span
class="page">Page 175</span></a> catastrophe show no signs of decadence;
the latest specimens of its linear writing show a marked advance on
those of preceding periods. A civilization in full strength and
growth was suddenly and fatally arrested. Everywhere throughout
the palace at Knossos there are traces of a vast conflagration.
The charred ends of beams and pillars, the very preservation of
the clay tablets with their enigmatic records, a preservation due,
probably, to the tremendous heat to which they were exposed by the
furious blazing of the oil in the store jars of the magazines, the
traces of the blackening of fire upon the walls&mdash;everything
tells of an overwhelming tragedy. Nor was the catastrophe the result
of an accident. There is no mistaking the significance of the fact
that in the palace scarcely a trace of precious metal, and next
to no trace of bronze has been discovered. Fire at Knossos was
accompanied by plunder, and the plundering was thorough. A few
scraps of gold-leaf, and the little deposit of bronze vessels that
had been preserved from the plunderers by the fact that the floor
of the room in which they were found had sunk in the ruin of the
conflagration, are evidences, better than absolute barrenness would
have been, to the fact that the place was pillaged with minute
thoroughness, and the unfinished stone jar in the sculptor's workshop
tells its own tale of a sudden summons from peaceful and happy
toil to the stern realities of warfare.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The evidence from Ph&aelig;stos and Hagia Triada tallies with that from
Knossos. Everywhere there <a name="page_176"><span class="page">Page
176</span></a> are the traces of fire on the walls, and a sudden
interruption of quiet and luxurious life. The very stone lamps
still stand in the rooms at Hagia Triada, and on the stairs of
the Basilica at Knossos, as they stood to lighten the last night
of the doomed Minoans. Of course there are no records, and if there
were we could not read them; but it is easy to imagine the disastrous
sea-fight off the mouth of the Kairatos River, or elsewhere along
the coast, the wrecks of the once invincible Minoan fleet driven
ashore in hopeless ruin in the shallow bay, like the Athenian fleet
at Syracuse, the swift march of the mainland conquerors up the
valley, the brief, desperate resistance of the palace guards, and
then the horrors of the sack, and the long column of flushed victors
winding down to their ships, laden with booty, and driving with them
crowds of captive women. Similar scenes must have been enacted at
Ph&aelig;stos and Hagia Triada, either by other forces of invaders,
or by the same host sweeping round the island.
</p>

<p class="indent">
From this overwhelming disaster the Minoan Empire never recovered.
The palace at Knossos was never reoccupied as a palace, at least on
anything like the scale of its former magnificence. The invaders
possibly departed as swiftly as they had come, or if, as seems
more probable, they eventually established themselves as a ruling
caste among the subject Minoans, they chose for their dwellings
other sites than those of the old palaces. The broken fragments of
the Minoan race crept back after the sack to the blackened ruins
of their holy and beautiful house, not to rebuild it, but to divide
its <a name="page_177"><span class="page">Page 177</span></a> stately
rooms and those of its dependencies by rude walls into poor
dwelling-houses, where they lived on&mdash;a very different life
from that of the golden days before the sack.

<p class="indent">
In their own way they strove to continue, possibly under the modifying
influence of the art tradition of their conquerors, the great story
of the art of Knossos. There is no abrupt break in the style of the
pottery and other articles belonging to the latest Minoan period, as
compared with that of the days before the catastrophe. Technical skill
is almost as great as ever; it is degeneration in the inspiration of
the art that has begun. The spirit of the nation has been broken,
and its art is no longer living. Though the old models are followed,
it is with less complete understanding, with a perpetually increasing
interval, and with less and less fidelity. 'With the inability to
create new ideas of art and life,' says Dr. Mackenzie, 'is coupled
the slavish adherence to inherited tradition and custom in both.
Nothing new is produced, and nothing old is changed.'[*] 'For Crete
the sack is &AElig;gospotami, Late Minoan III., the long months
that culminate in the surrender of Athens; the sack is Leipzig,
Late Minoan III., the slow closing in on Paris that leads up to the
abdication of Napoleon.'[**] Finally, even the technique fails, and
the great art which gave to the world the figures of the Cup-Bearer
and the King with the Peacock Plumes dies out in monstrosities.

</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_178"><span class="page">Page 178</span></a> The long
decay was to some extent arrested by the coming of other waves
of invaders, probably Ach&aelig;ans, to whose influence may be
attributed the change in customs which begins to show itself in the
post-Minoan period. Burning begins to take the place of inhumation
as a means of disposing of the dead; Continental types of weapons
make their appearance in the tombs; iron swords and daggers are
even found. In life the men who use these weapons are clad, not
with the Minoan loin-cloth, but with the garments which we associate
with the Greeks of the Classical period, garments which require
the use of the fibula or safety-pin to fasten them. The potter's
art begins to find new motives, and to develop the use of the human
form as a type of adornment in a manner almost entirely foreign to
the Minoan tradition. At last, perhaps four centuries after the
fall of Knossos, comes the great tidal wave of Dorian invasion,
engulfing the work alike of conquerors and conquered, and blowing
out all the landmarks of the ancient cultures.
</p>

<p class="indent">
And through all these changes, and ever since, the ruined House of
Minos remained absolutely deserted, until, more than 3,000 years
after the sack, its echoes were wakened by the spades and picks
of Dr. Evans's workmen. Around the ruins grim and cruel legends
swiftly grew up. The old traditions, dimly surviving in the minds
of the native Cretans, of the bull-fight and the prize-ring, and
the tribute of toreadors from the conquered nations, seemed to be
corroborated by the very decorations of the <a name="page_179"><span
class="page">Page 179</span></a> palace walls, still visible amidst
the ruins, and around them were woven the stories which have come
down to us as legends of early Greece. 'Let us place ourselves for
a moment,' says Dr. Evans, 'in the position of the first Dorian
colonists of Knossos after the great overthrow, when features now
laboriously uncovered by the spade were still perceptible amid the
mass of ruins. The name [Labyrinth] was still preserved, though
the exact meaning, as supplied by the native Cretan dialect, had
been probably lost. Hard by the western gate, in her royal robes,
to-day but partially visible, stood Queen Ariadne herself&mdash;and
might not the comely youth in front of her be the hero Theseus,
about to receive the coil of thread for his errand of liberation
down the mazy galleries beyond? Within, fresh and beautiful on the
walls of the inmost chambers, were the captive boys and maidens
locked up here by the tyrant of old. At more than one turn rose a
mighty bull, in some cases, no doubt, according to the favourite
Mycen&aelig;an motive, grappled with by a half-naked man. The type
of the Minotaur itself as a man-bull was not wanting on the soil
of prehistoric Knossos, and more than one gem found on this site
represents a monster with the lower body of a man and the forepart
of a bull.
</p>

<p class="indent">
'One may feel assured that the effect of these artistic creations
on the rude Greek settler of those days was not less than that of
the disinterred fresco on the Cretan workman of to-day. Everything
around&mdash;the dark passages, the lifelike figures <a
name="page_180"><span class="page">Page 180</span></a> surviving
from an older world, would conspire to produce a sense of the
supernatural. It was haunted ground, and then, as now, "phantasms"
were about. The later stories of the grisly King and his man-eating
bull sprang, as it were, from the soil, and the whole site called forth
a superstitious awe. It was left severely alone by the new-comers.
Another Knossos grew up on the lower slopes of the hill to the north,
and the old Palace site became "a desolation and hissing." Gradually
earth's mantle covered the ruined heaps, and by the time of the
Romans the Labyrinth had become nothing more than a tradition and
a name.'[*]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote *: <i>Monthly Review</i>, March, 1901, pp. 131, 132.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Who, then, were the invaders who, whether they remained as a ruling
caste in the land which they had conquered, or merely destroyed
and departed, inflicted upon the Minoan civilization a blow from
which it never recovered? The Cretans of Pr&aelig;sos, whose story
of the Sicilian expedition of Minos has already been mentioned,
stated to Herodotus that, after that great disaster, 'to Crete,
thus destitute of inhabitants ... other men, and especially the
Grecians, went, and settled there.' As Mr. Hogarth has pointed out,
'the men of Pr&aelig;sos were no doubt, in the true saga spirit,
foreshortening history by crystallizing a process into a single
event.' It is very improbable, in view of the evidence afforded by
the long survival and gradual decay of the Minoan tradition, that
there was any immediate general occupation of the island on the part
of the conquering race. The <a name="page_181"><span class="page">Page
181</span></a> process which finally resulted in the island of
Crete becoming 'the mixed land,' with a heterogeneous population
of Pelasgians, Dorians, Ach&aelig;ans, and other tribes, must have
been a gradual one, extending, in all probability, over several
centuries. Any large influx of foreign elements was impossible so
long as Crete was dominated by a great and warlike central power;
but once that power was broken by the catastrophe in which the
Palaces of Knossos and Ph&aelig;stos were overthrown, there was
nothing to hinder the gradual drifting in of the wandering tribes
of the &AElig;gean and of the North.
</p>

<p class="indent">
How that catastrophe came about we can see, not with any certainty
of detail, but with some amount of probability as to its general
outlines, from that echo of a period of wandering and strife in
the Mediterranean area which comes to us from the records of Ramses
III. at Medinet Habu. 'The isles were restless, disturbed among
themselves,' and it was one of the later waves of that storm which
broke itself against the armed strength of Egypt about 1200 B.C.
Probably the process of migration had been going on for several
generations. The rude but vigorous tribes of the North had been
pressing down upon the races which had created that remarkable
Bronze Age civilization of the Danubian area, whose relics have
been coming to light of late years; and these in their turn, under
the pressure from the North, had been moving down towards the
Mediterranean, driving before them the peoples, probably of kindred
stock to <a name="page_182"><span class="page">Page 182</span></a>
themselves, who had occupied the lands of the Mycen&aelig;an
civilization.
</p>

<p class="indent">
We know that long before the Homeric poems took shape the Ach&aelig;ans
had established themselves as the ruling caste in the Argolid,
in Laconia, and elsewhere; and that the pressure had begun even
while Mycen&aelig; was at the height of its power is suggested
by the figures on one of the steles of the Circle-Graves, where a
Mycen&aelig;an chieftain in his chariot is pursuing an enemy whose
leaf-shaped sword shows that he was one of the Danubian race. The
Mycen&aelig;an was the victor in the first shock; but the steady
pressure of the tribes from the North was not to be permanently
resisted, and the end was the establishment of an alien race in
power at Mycen&aelig;. The Mycen&aelig;an stele, where the chief
of the ancient stock pursues his Northern assailant, has its
<i>motif</i> reversed in the archaic Greek stele discovered by
Dr. Pernier at Gortyna, where a big Northerner with round shield
and greaves threatens a tiny Minoan or Mycen&aelig;an, crouching
behind his figure-of-eight shield. The two rude pictures may be
taken as typical of the beginning and the end of the process which
resulted in the establishment of the race of Agamemnon at 'Golden
Mycen&aelig;.' Pressed upon thus by the warlike Ach&aelig;ans,
perhaps already forced from their homes on the mainland, the
Mycen&aelig;ans of Tiryns and Mycen&aelig; were obliged to fare
forth in search of new dwelling-places. Not unnaturally the emigrants
may have turned to the land from which their civilization had <a
name="page_183"><span class="page">Page 183</span></a> originally
sprung, in the expectation that the Cretans would not refuse a
welcome and a home to men of their own stock. Seemingly they were
disappointed in their expectation. The Minoans, or, at least, the
Minoan rulers, were not prepared to admit peacefully the incursion
of this new element into their kingdom; and the wanderers, under
the spur of desperate need, took by force what was denied to them as
suppliants. So, in all probability, the glory of the Minoan Empire
was destroyed by the hands of its own children, the descendants
of men whom Knossos herself had sent forth to hold her mainland
colonies.[*]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote *: <i>Cf</i>. Dr. Mackenzie, <i>Annual of the British
School at Athens</i>, vol. xiii., pp. 424, 425.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
In such circumstances there would be no sudden eclipse of the ancient
culture. Modified slightly, if at all, by the influx of what, after
all, was a kindred element, it would persist, as the evidence shows
it persisted, until it perished of natural decay. Even when the
Ach&aelig;ans, and, later still, the Dorians, followed in the wake
of the Mycen&aelig;an immigrants, though their advent brought, as
we have seen, important changes in customs and in art motives,
the ancient native culture remained the fundamental element of
the newer civilization. It has been pointed out by Mr. Hogarth
that the Geometric vases of the early Iron Age in Crete exhibit
in their decoration merely stylized Minoan motives, while 'the
shields and other bronzes of the Id&aelig;an Cave, the latest of
which come down probably to <a name="page_184"><span class="page">Page
184</span></a> the ninth or even the eighth century, are artistic
descendants of Minoan masterpieces modified by some element of
uncouthness which was probably of Northern origin.'[*]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote *: <i>Fortnightly Review</i>, October, 1908, p. 602.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Thus in slow decay, after the great catastrophe, passed away the
great civilization of the Minoan Empire. Not all of the tribes
which had owned the dominion of the House of Minos were content,
however, to remain as subjects to the mainland conquerors. The
destruction of the central power at Knossos must have involved, as
Dr. Evans has suggested,[*] the collapse of much of the commerce
on which the island of the Hundred Cities depended for the support
of its great population. Already in the reign of Amenhotep III.
of Egypt, that powerful monarch had been obliged to establish a
special coastguard service at the mouths of the Nile to protect
his trade-routes against the Lycian pirates. When the Minoan fleet
was no longer in being to police the &AElig;gean, these and other
piratical races must have quickly driven the Cretan merchant marine
from the seas. The purple fisheries and the oil trade would dwindle
and die, and the population which had been supported by them would be
driven from a land which could no longer maintain it. The colonizing
movement which has left traces of Minoan culture in Anatolia, in
Palestine, in Sicily, and even in Spain, began, no doubt, at an
earlier period, when the Empire of the Sea-Kings was in its full
strength; <a name="page_185"><span class="page">Page 185</span></a>
but it probably received a considerable impulse at this time of
forced emigration. The sudden introduction of the same culture
into Cyprus at some period after 1400 B.C. has been referred to
conquest by men of the &AElig;gean race, who may very well have
been the men of Knossos driven forth by the pressure of altered
conditions to find a new home for themselves.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote *: 'Scripta Minoa,' p. 59.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The Mycen&aelig;an pottery found at Tell-el-Amarna shows that there
was still an opening in Egypt for the products of &AElig;gean art
at least as late as the reign of Akhenaten; and it is more than
probable that in Egypt many of the <i>&eacute;migr&eacute;s</i>
of the Minoan <i>d&eacute;b&acirc;cle</i> found a home. The art
of the reign of Akhenaten is characterized by the somewhat sudden
outburst of a naturalistic style almost entirely foreign to the
Egyptian tradition; and, as Mr. Hall foresaw eleven years ago,
it has been suggested[*] that the naturalism of Tell-el-Amarna
owes some of its inspiration to the influence of the fugitives
who brought with them from Crete the traditions of the great art
of Knossos. Such a suggestion is no longer so improbable as it
seemed to be in 1901, when it was still a tenable theory that the
new development of Egyptian art was due to Mesopotamian influence,
and came from Mitanni with Queen Tyi, the wife of Amenhotep III.
Now that it is certain that Tyi was no Mitannian, but a native
Egyptian, that door is closed, and we must suppose either that
Egyptian art suddenly and spontaneously <a name="page_186"><span
class="page">Page 186</span></a> awakened to a new style of vision
and execution, from which, again, it as suddenly departed, or else
that some foreign influence was working strongly upon the rigid
Egyptian convention, modifying and vivifying it. If a foreign influence,
why not the influence of the Minoan <i>&eacute;migr&eacute;s</i>,
whose art we at least know to have been capable of such an effect?
Of course, it is, after all, matter of surmise, and perhaps the
chances are rather in favour of the new art of Akhenaten's time
having been a genuinely native growth, influenced and inspired by
the new ideas with which the heretic King was seeking to leaven
the national life; but it is certainly far from unlikely that the
break-up of the Minoan Empire did influence the art of Egypt, and
perhaps that or other nations, in a manner something similar to,
though on a smaller scale than, that in which the capture of
Constantinople influenced the culture of Europe in the fifteenth
century.

We have already seen the evidence for the migration of Minoan tribes
of a later age in the assault of the Zakkaru and Pulosathu upon
Egypt 200 years after the fall of Knossos, and the establishment
of the latter tribe as an independent power upon the coast of
Palestine&mdash;events which may have been due to the advance of
another wave of Northern colonists upon the shores of Crete. One
more glimpse of the dying sea-power of the Cretan race, now itself
disorganized and predatory, is given us by the Golenischeff papyrus,
which tells, among other adventures of the unfortunate Wen-Amon,
envoy of Her-hor, <a name="page_187"><span class="page">Page
187</span></a> the priest-King of Upper Egypt (<i>circa</i> 1100
B.C.), how the Egyptian ambassador was threatened with capture by
eleven ships of Zakru pirates, who put into Byblos when he was
about to sail thence. Whether these were genuine Minoans or not,
it is impossible to tell; their immediate connection was apparently
with Dor, on the coast of Palestine; but their name suggests the
town of Zakro, in Eastern Crete, and it is not unlikely that they
belonged to the same race as the Zakkaru of the time of Ramses
III.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Thereafter the Egyptian records are silent as to the scattered
tribes of Crete, just as they had been silent since the rise of
the Nineteenth Dynasty as to the organized Empire of the Keftians.
The eleven shiploads of Zakru sea-robbers are the last degenerate
representatives of the great marine which, under the Kings of the
House of Minos, had once held the undisputed Empire of the &AElig;gean.
The ring of Minos was destined to lie for long ages beneath the
waves before the descendants of Theseus brought it up again.

CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="subtitle">THE PERIODS OF MINOAN CULTURE</p>

<p class="indent">
We must now endeavour to form some idea of the various periods
into which the long enduring culture of the Minoan Empire more
or less naturally falls, and to note some of the characteristic
features of each period. The chief aid in the formation of such
an idea is given by the remains of the pottery which have survived
from each period, and it is largely from the classification of
the pottery at Knossos and other sites that the scheme adopted
by Dr. Evans and other workers has been derived. The deposit left
by Neolithic man on the hill of Kephala averages about 6 metres
in thickness below the later deposit which marks the occupation
of the site by the post-Neolithic culture. We are thus led to an
almost fabulous antiquity for the first occupation of the site.
In the earliest beginnings of human development, progress, with
its consequent accumulation, is slow, and if we allow a rate of
3 feet of deposit for each thousand years, we shall probably not
be very far wrong. Such an allowance brings us to about 10,000
B.C. as the time <a name="page_189"><span class="page">Page
189</span></a> when Neolithic man began his first settlement on
the hill of Knossos.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<i>Neolithic Age</i>.&mdash;The remains found in the deposit of
this period are naturally of a very simple and primitive character.
They consist of pottery, handmade without any use of the wheel,
and hand-burnished, black in colour, and, in the latest specimens,
adorned with incised ornament, which is sometimes filled in with a
white chalky substance. While this description is characteristic
of the deposit generally, a gradual progress in the potter's art is
traceable from the virgin soil upwards. In the earliest stratum,
immediately above the depositless virgin soil, the pottery, for the
depth of the first metre, was entirely plain, unfired, polished
within and without, with no appearance of narrowed necks or moulded
bases. The next metre shows the beginning of incised ornament, but
in almost inappreciable quantity, and the third and fourth metres
show the gradual, but extremely slow, growth of this species of
decoration, the proportion of incised vases in the fourth metre only
reaching 3 per cent. The fifth metre deposit, however, discloses one
important innovation. The proportion of incised vases is scarcely
greater than in the preceding stratum, but almost all of them have
the incisions filled in with the white chalky substance already
alluded to, forming a geometric design of white upon black. Along
with this new development of the incised ware goes a development
of the unincised, whose surface is now not only polished to the
highest <a name="page_190"><span class="page">Page 190</span></a>
degree of lustre, but is thereafter rippled in vertical lines by the
pressure of some blunt instrument, so as to produce an undulating
effect, like that of the ripple marks on sand. The rippling of
the unincised pottery continues along with the chalk filling of
the incised through the remainder of the Neolithic series, and,
in fact, appears to have enjoyed an even superior popularity. In
the sixth metre from the virgin soil indications begin to present
themselves of the fact that the Neolithic period is about to draw
to a close, for some of the pottery is beginning to assume the
shapes which are characteristic of the painted ware of the earliest
Minoan period, and in the following metre paint begins to make its
appearance as a means of decoration in rivalry with the incision
and rippling of the earlier strata. From this point, then, we begin
to get into touch with the genuine Minoan periods, of which, according
to Dr. Evans's classification, there are three&mdash;Early, Middle,
and Late Minoan&mdash;each in its turn subdivided into three
sub-periods.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<i>Early Minoan I</i>.&mdash;The pottery of this period takes over
in great part the style of the primitive hand-burnished black ware
inherited from the preceding age. But though this supplies the
greater proportion of the material, it is not the characteristic
feature. This is supplied by the fact that the potter now begins
to use paint as a means for producing the lustrous black surface
which his Neolithic predecessor produced by hand-burnishing. A
lustrous black glaze medium is spread as a slip over the <a
name="page_191"><span class="page">Page 191</span></a> surface of
the clay, so as to produce an effect generally similar to that of
the hand-polished ware, and on this lustrous slip the decoration
is painted, generally in white, more rarely in vermilion. Thus we
have painted vases, with light design upon a dark ground.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Having made this step, the artist varied his procedure by applying
the black slip itself as the decoration in bands upon the natural
buff colour of the clay, thus giving a decorative scheme of dark
design upon a light ground. The ware now for the first time gives
evidence of having been fired. The primitive 'bucchero,' still
surviving alongside of the painted pottery, is very closely related
to the imported vases found by Petrie in First Dynasty tombs at
Abydos; and a further link with Egypt is afforded by the fact that
vases of Proto-Dynastic Egyptian form in diorite and syenite were
discovered in the south and east quarters of the palace at Knossos.
Early Minoan I. is thus to be equated with the earliest beginnings
of Dynastic rule in Egypt&mdash;that is to say, it dates from about
5500 B.C. if Petrie's date for the First Dynasty be adopted, or
from about 3400 B.C. if the Berlin dating be preferred. From this
period there survive no remains of building at Knossos.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<i>Early Minoan II</i>.&mdash;The distinguishing characteristic
of the second period of Early Minoan is the greater freedom and
originality shown in the designs of the vases. The style of painted
decoration remains much the same as in the preceding period; <a
name="page_192"><span class="page">Page 192</span></a> but the
vases now develop long spouts or beaks, and are the 'beak-jugs'
(Schnabelkanne) of the German arch&aelig;ologists. While a tendency
may be observed to vary the straight line decoration of Early Minoan
I. by the introduction of simple curves, there is also a revival
of the fashion for the old incised geometric-patterned ware. A
curious development of this period is found in the mottled ware
from Vasiliki, where the decoration was accomplished neither by
incising nor by painting a design, but by a method of firing in
which the vases, first painted red, were so placed that the hot
coals actually came into contact with the vases at certain points,
and produced black patches upon the red paint. The resultant mottled
surface was then hand-polished, and sometimes, but more rarely,
used as the medium for a design in white. To this period belong the
oldest parts of the deposit at Hagios Onouphrios, and the greater
part of the contents of the bee-hive chamber tomb at Hagia Triada,
where, along with incised and early painted vases, were found copper
daggers with very short triangular blades, a number of rude stone
seals, and very primitive idols, rudely imitating the human form.
There are still no traces of any surviving building on the hill
of Knossos, nor is there any definite link with Egypt to afford
an opportunity for determining the date of the period.

<p class="indent">
<i>Early Minoan III</i>.&mdash;In this period the proportion of
painted vases steadily increases, though for a time there is also
a revival of the incised ornament, <a name="page_193"><span
class="page">Page 193</span></a> attributed by Dr. Evans to influence
from the Cyclades, which at this time also gave to Crete the idea
of the flat, banjo-shaped human figurines which are characteristic
of the early deposits of Melos and Amorgos.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The use of the potter's wheel probably now begins, and the clay is
carefully sifted and fired, the favourite colour scheme being white
on lustrous brown or black slip, though sometimes the alternative
scheme of dark upon light is adopted; and vases are sometimes fashioned
out of very thin clay, in anticipation of the fine egg-shell Kamares
ware of Middle Minoan II. The chief decorative motive is a horizontal
band, or more than one, around the upper part of the vase. On these
bands the chief ornament is the zig-zag, and curves directly derived
therefrom, and the spiral begins to appear as a form of decoration.
It is uncertain whether the credit for the origination of this
favourite form of decorative motive is to be attributed to Egypt
or to Crete. Miss Hall[*] regards the Early Minoan III. spirals
as late-comers in the field, attributing the first development of
the spiral to the painters of Egyptian pre-Dynastic vases; but Mr.
H. R. Hall[**] denies the right of the volutes on the pre-Dynastic
vases to be regarded as spirals at all, considers that the true
spiral appears suddenly in Egypt as 'a new and unprecedented thing'
about the beginning of <a name="page_194"><span class="page">Page
194</span></a> the Middle Kingdom, and infers that in its use the
Cretans were original, and the Egyptians merely borrowers; while
Dr. Evans[***] denies originality to both, and holds that the use
of the spiral was first developed on the European side of the
&AElig;gean.

<p class="indent">
The fact that the seals of this period show motives derived from
the Egyptian Sixth Dynasty 'button-seals' suggests that Early Minoan
III. is to be equated with the end of the Old Kingdom in Egypt.
This, however, is but a slight help as to the positive date of
the Minoan period, owing to the huge gap between the different
systems of Egyptian chronology. All that can be said is that on
Petrie's system of dating the Minoan period which is contemporary
with the end of the Sixth Dynasty would date about 4000 B.C., and
on the Berlin system about 2475 B.C. Though the two cultures are
contemporaneous, it is, of course, by no means to be inferred that
the art of Early Minoan III. has left us any relics which are worthy
of being placed on a level with the wonderful work of the Egyptian
Old Kingdom artists. The primitive pictographs on the bead-seals
of this period mark the beginnings of this form of Minoan script,
which persisted until Late Minoan I., when it was at last superseded
by the linear form of writing which had made its appearance in
Middle Minoan III.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<i>Middle Minoan I</i>.&mdash;With this period we have distinct
advance in more directions than one. The Minoan artist is beginning
to feel his way towards <a name="page_195"><span class="page">Page
195</span></a> that polychrome style of decoration which reached
such a remarkable development in the Kamares vases of the succeeding
stage. In the decoration of his ware, which does not exhibit any
marked advance in form upon that of Early Minoan III., he has begun
to supplement the familiar white on the dark slip by adding yellow,
orange, red, and crimson. The Petsofa figurines, already alluded
to, which belong to this period, have a colour scheme of black
and white, red and orange. Along with this development of the use
of colour goes a corresponding advance in design. The motives of
the former period are continued, but are much more developed, and
more freely handled. Instead of being stiffly disposed in bands
round the vessel, they are now frequently grouped with the idea
of covering the ground of the vases in a graceful manner without
any attempt at formal definition of the limits of each article of
the design, the artist's idea being simply to fill, in a manner
satisfying to the eye, the space upon which he had to work. The
zonal system still persists side by side with the freer style, and
is often very skilfully handled as a means of decoration. One of
the characteristic features of Middle Minoan ceramic art&mdash;the
use of relief to enhance the effect of the polychrome decoration
through the addition of contrasts of light and shade&mdash;is seen
coming into use in the earliest part of the period.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Decoration is still geometric, and was to continue so for long.
Not until Middle Minoan III. do we <a name="page_196"><span
class="page">Page 196</span></a> get a really naturalistic style
of decorative art. But in Middle Minoan I. there are indications
which, though slight, seem to point to a striving after realism
on the part of some of the artists of the period. This tendency
is apparent even in some of the geometric designs, which are so
disposed as to form an approach to naturalistic patterns. But the
most remarkable example of the tendency is seen in a fragment of
a vase from Knossos, figured by Dr. Mackenzie,[*] on which the
figures of three of the Cretan wild goats are followed by that
of a gigantic beetle with a tail. 'The subject of the design,'
says Dr. Mackenzie, 'in its naturalistic character is so advanced
that, were it not for the company in which the fragments occur,
we should be tempted to assign it to a much later age.' It is
unfortunate that only a part of the design has survived, and that
no parallel to it has ever been found. Was it merely a sport, the
freak of some ancient potter who was weary of the conventional
designs of his time, and tried his hand at something new, combining
the wild life that he could see from the window of his workshop
with that which crawled upon its floor, without ever dreaming of
the problem he was setting for the students of 4,000 years later to
exercise themselves upon? The style of the goat and beetle fragment
is dark upon light. The goats are surrounded by an incised outline,
and filled in with lustrous black glaze; the beetle is drawn freely
in the black glaze, without incision, <a name="page_197"><span
class="page">Page 197</span></a> almost as though it had been a
humorous afterthought of the potter.

<p class="indent">
Middle Minoan I. has no surviving link with Egyptian art, a fact
which may be explained by the consideration that from the end of the
Sixth Dynasty to the establishment of the Eleventh, Egypt appears
to have been passing through a time of great confusion. The period
is practically a Dark Age so far as Egyptian history is concerned.

<p class="indent">
<i>Middle Minoan II</i>.&mdash;We now come to the period when the
first undoubted traces of the Cretan palaces begin to reveal themselves.
The chief architectural remains of the period are, however, not at
Knossos, but at Ph&aelig;stos. There the Theatral Area, at least,
was in existence early in this period, possibly in the later part
of the preceding one. But at Knossos the chief evidence for the
high state of civilization attained in this period is the pottery,
which reaches a very advanced development. This is the age of the
splendid polychrome vessels of the type called 'Kamares,' from
the cave on Mount Ida where they were first discovered by Mr. J.
L. Myres. The vases and cups of this fabric, from the delicacy of
their forms, the grace of their designs, and the richness of their
colour, are among the most notable survivals of Minoan ceramic
art. The clay is fine and carefully sifted, and the walls of the
vessels are of extreme thinness and delicacy, approaching to that
of the finest egg-shell china. The designs upon the vases <a
name="page_198"><span class="page">Page 198</span></a> are often
moulded in low relief as well as painted, and the thinness of their
walls, the form of their handles, and the knobs upon them, which
are evidently meant to suggest rivets, show that the potters of
the time were endeavouring to emulate the achievements of their
brother artists, the metal workers. The designs upon the vases
themselves are conventional, the idea being to produce a rich and
harmonious effect of form and colour rather than to secure any
imitation of Nature. Indeed, the patterns are very largely geometric;
the zig-zag, the cross, and concentric circles occur frequently;
and when plant life is imitated it is skilfully conventionalized,
as in the case of the water-lily cup, perhaps the most beautiful
specimen of the ware of the period, on which the white petals start
from a centre at the foot of the cup and enfold its body. The ground
of this cup is lustrous black, and the white of the petals is
accentuated by thin lines of red, while a geometric pattern moulded
in low relief runs round the rim of the cup above the waterlilies
(<a href="#plate_XXIX">Plate XXIX. 4</a>). The colours of the vases
are varied, consisting chiefly of white, orange, crimson, red, and
yellow, and each colour is used in several shades. 'Black shades into
purple, white into cream; brown has sometimes a red, and sometimes
an olive tint; yellows are either pale or orange; and red is not
only a crude vermilion, but is weakened to pink, or strengthened
with shades of orange and cherry and terra-cotta.' In the decoration
of the vases both styles flourish side by <a name="page_199"><span
class="page">Page 199</span></a> side, dark design upon light ground,
and light upon dark. In some vessels of the period there is a
combination of conventionalized naturalistic ornament and geometric
design.
</p>

<p class="indent">
A distinct link between Egypt and Middle Minoan II. is afforded by
the fact that at Kahun, close to the pyramid of Senusert II., near
the Fayum, Professor Petrie discovered vases which are unquestionably
of Kamares type, while the synchronism with the Twelfth Dynasty was
fully established by Professor Garstang's discovery at Abydos of
fragments of a polychrome vessel of late Middle Minoan II. type in
an untouched tomb, which also contained glazed steatite cylinders
with the names of Senusert III. and Amenemhat III. Middle Minoan
II., then, equates with the times of the Twelfth Egyptian Dynasty,
a period which was in many respects the most brilliant of Egyptian
history.
</p>

<p class="indent">
When we come to inquire, however, as to positive date, we are still
met, though almost for the last time, by the great discrepancy
between the systems of Egyptian dating. The Twelfth Dynasty is
placed by Professor Petrie at about 3400 B.C., by the traditional
dating about 2500 B.C., while the modern German school brings down
the date as low as 2000 B.C. No more can be said than that Middle
Minoan II. certainly does not begin earlier than 3400 B.C., and
can scarcely begin later than 2000 B.C. The period closes with the
evidence of a great catastrophe at Knossos, in which the palace <a
name="page_200"><span class="page">Page 200</span></a> was burned;
and, as already mentioned, the fact that Ph&aelig;stos shows no
evidence of such a disaster at this point has roused the suspicion
that the Lords of Ph&aelig;stos may have been responsible for the
destruction of the greater palace.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<i>Middle Minoan III</i>.&mdash;To this period belong the beginnings
of the second palace at Knossos. The western portion of the palace
probably dates largely from this time, though it was altered and
extended later; and we must place here the Temple Repositories,
and certain other chambers on the northeast side of the Central
Court, though they were covered up and built over in Late Minoan
I. At all events, a very great and splendid building must have
existed upon the site at this time. Egypt was passing through the
dark period between the Thirteenth and Seventeenth Dynasties, which
includes the domination of the Hyksos; but the civilization of
Crete, on the contrary, was continually and steadily advancing. To
this age belong many of the most interesting and precious relics
of the Minoan culture.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The art of the period gradually undergoes a great change from that
of Middle Minoan II. Polychrome decoration steadily declines, and
is superseded by monochrome. The beautiful lustrous black glaze
ground of the vases is replaced by a dull purple slip on which
the decoration is often laid in a powdery white paint. The best
designs are found in this white upon a lilac or mauve ground. In
the designs themselves conventionalism and geometric ornament <a
name="page_201"><span class="page">Page 201</span></a> pass away,
and are followed by a development of naturalism. Dr. Mackenzie
has pointed out that it is to this growth of naturalism that we
must trace the gradual disappearance of polychrome decoration.
'Once we have the portrayal of natural objects, such as flowers,
which becomes so rife before the close of the Middle Minoan Age,
it soon becomes apparent that a scale of colours, which in their
relation to each other were capable of producing polychrome effects
of great beauty, was quite inadequate towards the reproduction of
the natural colours of objects. Thus green, for example, which is
the first necessity towards the rendering of leaves and stems, did
not exist in the colour repertory of the vase painter. The ceramic
artist must thus have felt that with his limited scale of colours
he could not produce the same natural effects as the wall-painter
with his. On the other hand, he must have been equally conscious
that natural objects such as flowers did not look natural in a
polychrome guise which was not that of Nature. The only solution
of the colour difficulty in the circumstances was a compromise in
the shape of a convention. Thus the tendency came into being to
make all natural objects either simply light on a dark ground,
or dark on a light ground.'[*]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote *: <i>Journal of Hellenic Studies</i>, vol. Xxvi., part
I, pp. 257, 258.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The two flowers most generally used for the purpose of ornamentation
are the lily and the crocus. For the first time the importance of
pottery as an evidence of the condition of the art of the period
<a name="page_202"><span class="page">Page 202</span></a> is second
to that of other artistic products. It is to Middle Minoan III. that
there belongs the wonderful fabric of fa&iuml;ence, of which so
many specimens were discovered in the Temple Repositories. In them
the same tendency towards naturalism reveals itself. The wild-goat
suckling its kid, the flying-fish, the porcelain vases, one of them
with cockle-shell relief, and another with ferns and rose-leaves
on a ground of pale green, are all instances of the naturalistic
growth. Evidence is also afforded of a great delight in scenes
connected with the sea, and we have the flying-fish and the seal
with the seaman in his skiff defending himself against the attacks
of the sea-monster, to witness to the Minoan appreciation alike
of the curiosities and the dangers of the deep.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Fresco-painting also begins to leave survivals, and we have particularly
the fresco of the Blue Boy gathering white crocuses. At the beginning
of the period the old form of pictographic writing is still in general
use, but by the close of Middle Minoan III. the earlier type of the
linear script, Class A, has made its appearance and is extensively
used. The Middle Minoans of the Third period were the fabricators
of the huge knobbed and corded <i>pithoi</i>, or jars, some of them
with the curious 'trickle,' ornament, which is surely decoration
reduced to its last straits. The artist merely dabbed quantities
of brown glaze paint around the rims of his jars, and allowed it
to trickle down the sides at its own will. The result is curious,
but can scarcely be <a name="page_203"><span class="page">Page
203</span></a> called beautiful (<a href="#plate_IX">Plate IX.
2</a>). 'Ab-nub's child, Sebek-user, deceased,' whose statuette
was found at Knossos, gives us a point of connection between the
earlier part of Middle Minoan III. and the Thirteenth Egyptian
Dynasty, while the alabastron of Khyan links the later portion of
the period with the Hyksos domination in Egypt. The King who built
the great tomb at Isopata, already described, must have reigned
at Knossos during this period.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<i>Late Minoan I</i>.&mdash;In this period we come into touch with
a great deal of the fine work of the Royal Villa at Hagia Triada,
which has been already described. A considerable portion of the
area of the palace at Knossos, dating from the preceding age, is
now covered up by new construction, and the second palace begins
to assume the form which was completed in the subsequent period.
In pottery the naturalistic style still persists, but the technique
begins to modify, and the white design on a dark ground occurs less
frequently than design in dark glaze paint on the natural light
ground of the clay. Ornament begins to partake increasingly of a
marine character; the octopus, the Triton shell, the nautilus, and
seaweed, appear as designs, and are executed in lifelike fashion,
which contrasts strongly with the later conventionalized method
of representing them. Indeed, Middle Minoan III. And Late Minoan
I. and II. show a distinct appreciation of and delight in all the
beauty and wonder of the sea, which suggest the important part
which it played in the lives of the Cretan populace. 'At <a
name="page_204"><span class="page">Page 204</span></a> ports where
sailors and fishermen and divers for sponge and purple went and
came, it was natural for an imaginative race to acquire that sense
of the magic and mystery of the sea, that curiosity about the life
in its depths, which found expression in these ceramic pictures.'[*]

<p class="indent">
Along with the marine designs went naturalistic representations of
flowers and grasses&mdash;the lily and the crocus, already familiar
from earlier work, the Egyptian lotus in a form adapted to the taste
of the Minoan artist, and ivy leaves and tendrils. A peculiarly
graceful design on a vase from Zakro shows an adaptation of the
Egyptian lotus, presenting that favourite Nilotic motive in a style
more flexible and easy than that of the native representations of
it. The design in this case is painted in white on a reddish-brown
ground, and its peculiarity is that the white was laid on after
the vase had been fired, and can be removed with the finger (<a
href="#plate_XXIX">Plate XXIX. 2</a>). The three vases from Hagia
Triada, the Boxer, the Harvester, and the Chieftain, belong to
this period, as do also the frescoes of the Hunting Cat and the
Climbing Plants, and probably the Royal Gaming Board from the palace
at Knossos. At this time, too, we come upon the long bronze swords
which had succeeded the daggers of the preceding ages. Hieroglyphic
writing is now superseded by the linear script of Class A, which now
comes into regular use, although at Knossos <a name="page_205"><span
class="page">Page 205</span></a> the documents in this script,
according to Dr. Evans, are only to be found in the stratum belonging
to the last period of Middle Minoan, their place being supplied
by Class B, which occurs only at Knossos.
</p>

<p class="indent">
At Hagia Triada and Gournia the older forms of vase are mingled with
early specimens of the type variously known as 'B&uuml;gelkanne,'
'Vases &agrave; &Eacute;trier,' or 'Stirrup-vases.' These vases,
named from the stirrup-like appearance of their curving handles,
may more correctly be called 'false-necked vases,' from the fact
that the neck to which the handles unite is closed, and another
neck is formed, farther away from the handles, for convenience
in pouring. The false-necked vase is the characteristic pottery
type of Late Minoan III., and occurs very frequently on the
Mycen&aelig;an sites of that period. The seals with fantastic forms
of monsters, such as those found in such numbers at Zakro, date from
the beginning of Late Minoan I., and to this period also belong
the earlier of the Shaft- or Circle-Graves at Mycen&aelig;, so that
now for the first time Minoan can be equated with Mycen&aelig;an. We
are still without any system of dating that is absolutely certain,
but this is the last period of which such a remark is true. The
next period brings us into touch with Egyptian synchronisms whose
date is certain to within a few years.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<i>Late Minoan II</i>.&mdash;To Late Minoan II. belong the great
glories of the second palace at Knossos, which arrived at its greatest
splendour just before the time at which it was to be destroyed. Now
<a name="page_206"><span class="page">Page 206</span></a> were
built the Throne Room and its antechamber, and the Royal Villa
with its da&iuml;s and throne and columned hall, while the walls
of the completed palace were covered with the splendid frescoes
of whose beauties the Cup-Bearer and the spectators watching the
games give us evidence. The reliefs in hard plaster, such as the
bull's head and the King with the peacock plumes, show the style
of decoration which gave variety on the walls to the paintings on
the flat. In pottery the change of style and decoration is gradual,
but quite pronounced. The chief characteristic of the time is the
fabrication of large decorated vases and <i>pithoi</i>, such as
the beautiful papyrus relief vase of the Royal Villa, nearly 4
feet in height (<a href="#plate_XXIII">Plate XXIII.</a>; see also
<a href="#plate_XXX">Plate XXX.</a>). Naturalism still survives in
occasional designs, but the bulk of the design is conventional,
and the composition of the various elements is often extremely
skilful. A typical form of vessel of this period is the long narrow
strainer, which is borne by the Cup-Bearer in the palace fresco,
and of which various specimens have been found. In many cases these
strainers were made of variegated marble, though pottery was also
used for them.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The bronze vessels from the north-west house at Knossos, and the
swords from the earlier Zafer Papoura graves, testify to the skill
with which metal was wrought. One of these swords from the chieftain's
grave, the short weapon which the noble of Late Minoan II. carried
along with his long rapier, perhaps for parrying thrusts, as the
gallants <a name="page_207"><span class="page">Page 207</span></a>
of Queen Elizabeth's time used their daggers, has a pommel of
translucent agate, and a gold-plated hilt engraved with a design
of a lion chasing and capturing a wild-goat. Great bronze vessels
were wrought with splendid conventional designs, and some of the
stone vases of the period are amazing in the skill with which they
were worked and decorated. 'How the hard material was worked with
precision in the <i>inside</i> of vessels which have only the narrowest
of neck orifices, and that in an age of soft bronze tools, is as
great a mystery as the mode of working diorite and granite in
prehistoric Egypt.'[*] Perhaps the most splendid specimen is the
great amphora, 2 feet high by 6 feet in circumference, with its
two magnificent spiral bands, which was found in the so-called
Sculptor's Workshop at Knossos, beside the smaller vessel which
had only been roughed out when the catastrophe of the palace came.

The linear script, Class B, now supersedes the earlier type, Class

<p class="indent">
In this period we come for the first time into a sphere where there
is practically an absolute certainty in dating; for now we have the
Keftiu appearing in the tomb frescoes of the Eighteenth Dynasty
at Thebes, with their vessels of characteristic Minoan type, and
their purely Minoan style of dress and general appearance. Sen-mut's
tomb gives us a date about 1480 B.C., and Rekh-ma-ra's may bring
us down to 1450 B.C., or thereby. It is <a name="page_208"><span
class="page">Page 208</span></a> somewhat striking that the periods
of greatest splendour alike for the Egyptian Empire and for the
Minoan should virtually coincide. In either case, the duration
of the culmination of splendour was short. The magnificence of
the Egypt of Hatshepsut, Tahutmes III., and Amenhotep III., was
speedily to be clouded and dimmed by the disasters of the reign
of Akhenaten; but even before the glory of the Eighteenth Dynasty
had passed away, the sun of the Minoan Empire had set. Late Minoan
II., with all its triumphs of architecture and art, was brought to
an abrupt close by the sack of the palaces, probably about 1400
B.C., and the great frescoes of the palace at Knossos were the last
evidences of a magnificence which was never to be revived again
on Cretan soil.
</p>

<p class="indent">
During this period intercourse between Crete and Egypt must have
been frequent and close. It is not only indicated by the evidence
of the Sen-mut and Rekh-ma-ra tombs, but by the parallelism in
the styles of art in the two countries. The art of each remains
truly national, but the frescoes of Knossos and Hagia Triada and
those of the Eighteenth Dynasty in Egypt are inspired by the same
spirit, though in either case the result is modified by national
characteristics.

<p class="indent">
<i>Late Minoan III</i>.&mdash;This, the last period of the Minoan
civilization, commences with the destruction of the palace of Knossost
somewhere before 1400 B.C., and presents no definite line of
termination. <a name="page_209"><span class="page">Page 209</span></a>
The great style of art represented by the preceding period does
not at once degenerate into barbarism. If, as seems probable, the
men who destroyed the Cretan palaces were Mycen&aelig;ans of the
mainland, more or less of the same stock as the Cretan representatives
of the Minoan tradition, we can see how the catastrophe of the
palaces need not have been followed by any immediate catastrophe
of the art of Crete. At the same time the true spirit of the Minoan
race had been destroyed, and degeneration of the standard of art
naturally followed. The level of artistic work in the earlier part
of the period is still high&mdash;in fact, it is that of what is
considered the best Mycen&aelig;an art&mdash;the technical skill
which produced the masterpieces of the Palace period still survives,
but the inspiration which gave it life is gone. Originality in design
vanishes first, and is gradually followed by skill in execution;
the old types are reproduced in more and more slovenly fashion,
and at last even the material employed follows the example of
degeneration. This period of gradual decadence is, however, the
period of greatest diffusion of the products of Minoan, or, rather,
as we may now call it, of Mycen&aelig;an art. At Ialysos in Rhodes,
and in the lower town of Mycen&aelig;, types parallel with the work
of Crete are found, and Tell-el-Amarna furnishes specimens of pottery
whose degeneracy from the type of the Palace period declares them
to belong to these days of decadence. Specimens of Late Minoan
III. work are found at Tarentum, and the island of Torcello, near
Venice, and even as far <a name="page_210"><span class="page">Page
210</span></a> west as Spain. One of the characteristic features
of the period is the fact that the stirrup-vase, found at Hagia
Triada and Gournia in Late Minoan I., but almost totally wanting
in Late Minoan II., now becomes common.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Towards the close of the period the site of the palace at Knossos
was partially reoccupied by a humbler race of men, who used the
rooms that had once witnessed the pride of the Minoan Sovereigns,
dividing them up by flimsy partition-walls to suit their smaller
needs. An age of transition succeeded, during which the character
of the Cretan population was gradually modified by successive waves
of invasion from the mainland, until Crete assumed the guise of
'the mixed land,' under which Homer knew it; and finally came the
great invasion of the Dorians, which brought in for Crete, as for
the rest of Greece, the dark age which preceded the dawn of the
true Hellenic culture.

CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="subtitle">LIFE UNDER THE SEA-KINGS</p>

<p class="indent">
What manner of men were the people who developed the Bronze Age
civilization of Crete? Can we form any idea of their physical
characteristics, of their homes and social conditions, of the general
aspect of their daily life, and of the occupations in which they
were engaged? Such questions can only be answered more or less
generally in the absence of written material, or, rather, in our
lack of understanding of the written material that exists; but,
still, a considerable mass of evidence is in existence from which
some broad outlines may be deduced with moderate certainty, and
the object of this chapter is to present these outlines.
</p>

<p class="indent">
First, as to the physical characteristics of the race. Two lines
of evidence are here available. On the one hand, there is that
afforded by the actual remains of the bodies of men and women of
the Minoan race which have been exhumed from ossuaries of the Bronze
Age, and studied by anthropologists. <a name="page_212"><span
class="page">Page 212</span></a> Generally speaking, the result
of their investigations has been to show that the Minoans belonged
to the southernmost of the three great racial belts into which
the ancient peoples of Europe may be divided&mdash;the so-called
Mediterranean race. That is to say, they were a people of the
long-headed type, dark in colouring and small in stature. The average
height, estimated from the bones which have been measured, is somewhat
under 5 feet 4 inches, which is about 2 inches less than the average
of the modern Cretans, and corresponds more to the stature of the
Sardinians and Sicilians of the present time. A few skulls of the
broad-headed type appear among the general long-headedness, and
probably point to some intermixture of race; but, as a whole, the
people were long-headed. The shortness of stature indicated by the
bones is a feature which one would scarcely have inferred from the
other line of evidence available&mdash;the actual representations
of men and women of their own race which the Minoans have left in
their fresco-paintings; but allowance must, of course, be made
for the artistic convention which tended to accentuate slenderness
of figure, and therefore to increase apparent height.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Judging from the surviving pictures, the Minoan men were bronzed,
with dark hair and beardless faces; their figures were slender, and
their slenderness was made all the more conspicuous by the fashion
which prevailed of drawing in the waist by a tightly fastened belt,
which seems, in some cases at least, to have had metal edges; but
muscularly <a name="page_213"><span class="page">Page 213</span></a>
they were well developed, and the pictures suggest litheness and
agility in a high degree. 'One would say a small-boned race, relying
more on quickness of limb and brain than on weight and size.' The
hair of the men was worn in a somewhat elaborate fashion, being
done up in three coils on the top of the head, while the ends of
it fell in three long curls upon the shoulders. On the other hand,
their dress was extremely simple, consisting normally of nothing
but a loin-cloth, girt by the broad belt already mentioned, the
material of which the loincloth was made being frequently gaily
coloured or patterned, as in the case of the Cup-Bearer, whose
garment is adorned with a dainty quatre-foil design. That more
elaborate robes were worn on certain occasions of importance is
shown by the sarcophagus at Hagia Triada (<a href="#plate_XXVIII">Plate
XXVIII.</a>), where the lyre player wears a long robe coming down to
the ankles and bordered with lines of colour, while the other men
in the scene wear tucked robes reaching a little below the knees
(or possibly baggy Turkish trousers); and also by the Harvester
Vase, where the chief figure in the procession is clad in a stiff
garment, which has been variously interpreted as a wadded cuirass,
or as a cope of some stiff fabric.
</p>

<p class="indent">
On their feet they wore sometimes shoes, with puttees twisted round
the lower part of the leg, and sometimes half-boots, as shown on
the Chieftain Vase and one of the Petsofa figurines. Indeed, the
footgear of the Minoans seems to have been somewhat elaborate. In
the representations of the <a name="page_214"><span class="page">Page
214</span></a> Keftiu, on the walls of Rekh-ma-ra's tomb, the shoes
are white, and have bindings of red and blue, and in some cases
are delicately embroidered. Such examples as the shoe on an ivory
figure found at Knossos, and the terra-cotta model of a shoe found at
Sitia, show the daintiness with which the Minoans indulged themselves
in the matter of footwear. In personal adornment the men to some
extent made up for their simplicity in the matter of dress. The
Cup-Bearer wears a couple of thick bracelets on his upper arm,
and another, which bears an agate signet, on his wrist; and such
decorations seem to have been in common use. The King whose figure
in low relief has been reconstructed from fragments found at Knossos,
wears peacock plumes upon his head, while round his neck he has a
collar of fleur-de-lys, wrought, no doubt, in precious metal.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The Minoan women are depicted with a perfectly white skin, which
contrasts strongly with the bronzed hue of the men. The deep coppery
tint of the men, and the dead white skin of the women is, of course,
to be accepted only as a convention, similar to that adopted by
Egyptian artists, meant to express a difference of complexion caused
by greater or less exposure to the weather; and we need not imagine
that there was so great a contrast between the colouring of men
and women in actual life as would appear from the paintings. If
the dress of the male portion of the populace was simple, that
of the female was the reverse. An elaborate and tight-fitting <a
name="page_215"><span class="page">Page 215</span></a> bodice,
cut excessively low at the neck, covered, or affected to cover,
the upper part of the body, which is so wasp-waisted as to suggest
universal tight-lacing. From the broad belt hung down bell-shaped
skirts, sometimes flounced throughout their whole length, sometimes
richly embroidered, as in the case of a votive skirt represented
in fa&iuml;ence among the belongings of the Snake Goddess found
in the Temple Repositories. In some cases&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, that
of the votaress of the Snake Goddess&mdash;the skirt, below a small
panier or apron, is composed of different coloured materials combined
in a chequer pattern distantly resembling tartan. A fresco from
Hagia Triada represents a curious and elaborate form of dress,
consisting apparently of wide trousers of blue material dotted
with red crosses on a light ground, and most wonderfully frilled
and vandyked. Diaphanous material was sometimes used for part of
the covering of the upper part of the body, as in the case of some
of the figures from the Knossos frescoes. Hairdressing, as already
noticed, was very elaborate, and above the wonderful erections of
curls and ringlets which crowned their heads, the Minoan ladies, if
one may judge from the Petsofa figurines, wore hats of quite modern
type, and fairly comparable in size even with those of the present
day. A seal from Mycen&aelig;, representing three ladies adorned
with accordion-pleated skirts, shows that heels of a fair height were
sometimes worn on the shoes. Necklaces, bracelets, and other articles
of adornment were in general use, and the workmanship of some of
the surviving specimens <a name="page_216"><span class="page">Page
216</span></a> is astonishingly fine (<a href="#plate_XXXII">Plate
XXXII.</a>). Altogether, so far as can be estimated from the
representations which have come down to us, the appearance of a
Minoan assembly would, to a modern eye, seem curiously mixed. The
men would fit in with our ideas of their period, but the women
would remind us more of a European gathering of the mid-nineteenth
century.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The houses which were occupied by these modern-looking ladies and
their mates were unexpectedly unlike anything in the house-building
of the Classical period. There is little of the uniformity of style
and arrangement which characterizes the ordinary Greek house. The
Minoan burgher built his home as the requirements of his site and
of his household suggested, and was not the slave of any fixed
convention in the matter of plan. The houses at Gournia, Palaikastro,
and Zakro, which may be taken as typical specimens of ordinary Minoan
domestic architecture, must have been much more like modern houses
than anything that we know of in Greek towns of the Classical period;
and the elevations of Minoan villas preserved in the fa&iuml;ence
plaques from the chest at Knossos suggest the frontages of a suburban
avenue. Some of the Knossian plaques show houses of three and four
storeys, with windows filled in with a red material which, as Dr.
Evans suggests, may have been oiled and tinted parchment. In such
houses, as distinguished from the palaces, there was no separation
between the apartments of men and women. The <a name="page_217"><span
class="page">Page 217</span></a> fabric of the houses was generally
of sun-dried brick, reared upon lower walls of stone; some of the
Knossian villas, however, were plastered and timbered, the round
beam-ends showing in the frontage. Oblong windows took the place
of the light-wells which give indirect illumination to the palace
rooms. The accommodation must have been fairly extensive. The smaller
houses have six to eight rooms, the larger ones twice that number;
while one of the houses in Palaikastro has no fewer than twenty-three
rooms.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Within doors the walls were finished with smooth plaster, and probably
decorated with painting, though, of course, on a humbler scale than
in the palaces. The floors were of flagstones and cement, even
in the upper storeys, and in some cases of cobbles or of earth
rammed hard. The furniture of the rooms has perished, except in
the case of such articles as were of stone or plaster; but the
evidence we possess of the comfort and even the luxury of the life
of these times in other respects suggests that the townsfolk of
Gournia and the other Cretan towns were not lacking in any of the
essentials of a comfortable home life. The great chest at Knossos
which was once decorated with the fa&iuml;ence plaques was, of
course, part of the furnishing of a royal home, and we are not
to suppose that such magnificent pieces of furniture were common;
but in their own fashion the ordinary Minoan houses were doubtless
quite adequately appointed, and the great variety of <a
name="page_218"><span class="page">Page 218</span></a> domestic
utensils which has survived shows that life in the Bronze Age homes
of Crete was by no means a thing of primitive and rough-and-ready
simplicity, but was well and carefully organized in its details.
It has been remarked that 'cooking in Homer is monotonous, because
no one eats anything but roast meat'; but this accusation could
not be brought against the Minoans, who had evidently attained to
a considerable skill and variety in the way in which they prepared
their viands for the table. The three-legged copper pot which was
the most common vessel for cooking purposes was supplemented by
stewpans with condensing-lids, and a variety of other forms of
saucepan, while the number of different types of perforated vessels
for straining and other purposes shows the care with which the art
of cooking was attended to. Probably the Minoan kitchen, though
we are still much in the dark as to its form, was almost as well
equipped for its special functions as the kitchen of the present
day.
</p>

<p class="indent">
We are, unfortunately, without any evidence as to the appearance
of the great palaces in their finished state. The inner plan can
be traced, but it is difficult to arrive at any idea of what these
huge buildings must have looked like from the outside. It is fairly
evident, however, that there cannot have been any symmetrical balancing
of the different architectural features. The palaces were more
like small towns than simple residences, and the impression made
upon the eye must have been due more <a name="page_219"><span
class="page">Page 219</span></a> to the great mass and extent of
the building than to any symmetry of plan. Probably we must conceive
of them as great complex blocks of solid building, rising in terrace
above terrace, the flat roofs giving an appearance of squareness
and solidity to the whole. On a closer approach the eye would be
impressed by the wide and spacious courts, the stately porticoes,
the noble stairways, and the wealth of colour everywhere displayed;
but, on the whole, so far as can be judged, it was only from within
that the splendour of the Minoan palaces could be fairly estimated.
</p>

<p class="indent">
A palace such as that of Knossos sheltered an extraordinary variety
and complexity of life. An abundance of humbler rooms served for
the accommodation of the artists and artisans who were needed for
the service and adornment of the palace, and of whom whole companies
must have lived within the walls, 'dwelling with the king for his
work,' like the potters and foresters mentioned in Scripture. Several
shrines and altars provided for the religious needs of the community.
Rooms of state were set apart for public audiences and for council
meetings. In fact, the building was not only a King's dwelling-place,
but the administrative centre of a whole empire, and within its
walls there was room for the offices of the various departments
and for the housing of their records.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The domestic quarter of the palace still reveals in some of its
rooms the environment of luxury and beauty in which the Minoan
royalties lived. The <a name="page_220"><span class="page">Page
220</span></a> Queen's Megaron may be taken as typical. A row of
pillars rising from a low, continuous base divides the room into
two parts. The upper surface of the base on either side of the
pillars is of stucco moulded so as to form a long couch, which was
doubtless covered with cushions when the room was in use. Light
was furnished in the day-time, according to Cretan Palace practice,
not by windows, but by light-wells, of which there are two, one on
the south and one on the east side. In one of these light-shafts
the brilliant white stucco surface which reflected the light into
the room is decorated with a modelled and painted relief, of which
a fragment has survived, representing a bird of gorgeous plumage,
with long curving wing, and feathers of red, blue, yellow, white,
and black. Near the light-well on the other side of the line of
pillars, outside nature was brought within doors by a beautiful
piece of fresco-painting which shows fishes swimming through the
water, and dashing off foam-bells and ripples in their rapid course.
Along the north wall of the room ran another gay fresco, representing
a company of dancing-girls on a scale of half life-size. One of
the dancers is clad in a jacket with a yellow ground and blue and
red embroidered border, beneath which is a diaphanous chemise. Her
left arm is bent, and her right stretched forward; her features
are piquant, if not beautiful, and a slight dimple shows at the
corner of her lips. Her long black hair, elaborately waved and
crimped, floats out on either side of her head as she turns in the
<a name="page_221"><span class="page">Page 221</span></a> movement
of the dance. The fragments of decoration which have survived help us
to realize a very beautiful room, gay with colour, yet never garish
because of the softness of the indirect illumination, in which we may
imagine the Minoan Court ladies, in their modern gowns, reclining
on the cushions of the long couch, discussing the incidents of the
last bull-grappling entertainment, the skill of the young Athenian
Theseus, and the obvious infatuation of Princess Ariadne, or employing
their time more usefully in some of the wonderful embroidery-work
in which the fashion of the period delighted. By night the scene
in the palace would be even more picturesque. Greatstone lamps,
standing on tall bases, and each bearing several wicks on the margin
of its broad bowl of oil, flared in the rooms and corridors, lighting
up the brightly coloured walls, and sending many-tinted reflections
dancing from the bronze and copper vases and urns which decorated
the passages and the landings of the stairways; while through the
breadths of light and shadow moved in an always changing stream
of colour the gaily dressed figures of the Minoan Court.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Even at this exceedingly early stage of human progress, the various
branches of industry had become fairly separated and specialized,
more so, perhaps, than in the Homeric period, and a considerable
variety of tools was employed in the various crafts. The carpenter
was evidently a highly skilled craftsman, and the tools which have
survived show the variety of work which he undertook. At <a
name="page_222"><span class="page">Page 222</span></a> Knossos a
carefully hewn tomb held, along with the body of the dead artificer,
specimens of the tools of his trade&mdash;a bronze saw, adze, and
chisel. 'A whole carpenter's kit lay concealed in a cranny of a
Gournia house, left behind in the owner's hurried flight when the
town was attacked and burned. He used saws long and short, heavy
chisels for stone and light for wood, awls, nails, files, and axes
much battered by use; and, what is very important to note, they
resemble in shape the tools of to-day so closely that they furnish
one of the strongest links between the first great civilization
of Europe and our own.'[*] Such tools were, of course, of bronze.
Probably the chief industry of the island was the manufacture and
export of olive oil. The palace at Knossos has its Room of the
Olive Press, and its conduit for conveying the product of the press
to the place where it was to be stored for use; and probably many
of the great jars now in the magazines were used for the storage of
this indispensable article. As we have seen, Dr. Evans conjectures
that it was the decay of the trade in oil during the troubled days
after the sack of the palaces that drove the Minoans abroad from
their island home to seek their fortunes elsewhere. Besides the
trade in oil, it would seem that there must have been a trade in the
purple of the murex, and no doubt the Keftiu mariners found a ready
market for this much-prized product long before the Ph&oelig;nicians
dreamed of Tyrian purple. Minoan pottery was manifestly also an
article of export&mdash;a fragile cargo <a name="page_223"><span

of the Keftiu envoys in the Rekh-ma-ra frescoes carry ingots of
copper of the same shape as those found by Dr. Halbherr at Hagia
Triada suggests that Crete may have exported copper to Egypt in the
time of Tahutmes III. as Cyprus exported it in large quantities
in that of Amenhotep III.

It is unfortunate that so far we have no large-scale representations
of the ships in which these early masters of the ocean conducted the
sea-borne commerce of the &AElig;gean world. The various seal-stones
and impressions, and the gold ring from Mokhlos, are interesting,
but it would have been much more satisfactory had we been able to
see representations of the Minoan galleys as complete as those which
Queen Hatshepsut has left of the ships of her merchant squadron.
The vessels represented are almost universally single-masted, with
one bank of oars, whose number varies from five to eleven a side,
a high stern, and a bow ending either in a barbed point or an open
beak, which suggests resemblances to the galleys of the sea-peoples
who were defeated by Ramses III. In some instances the length of
the voyage undertaken appears to be indicated. A crescent moon on
the forestay, and another on the backstay of a vessel with seven
oars a side, may point to a two months' voyage, while a disc over
the beak of another which has no oars at all may indicate one of
a year's duration, or perhaps, more probably, one of a complete
month. The supreme part which the sea <a name="page_224"><span
class="page">Page 224</span></a> played in the life of the Cretans
is shown unmistakably by the fact that practically every Minoan site
of importance is on the coast, or within easy reach of it, while
the innate national delight in all the wonderful creatures of the
marine world is seen in the constant use of their forms as motives
in decorative work. No designs are so common on Minoan pottery as
those derived from the sea; the octopus, the murex, the nautilus,
the coral, and various forms of alg&aelig;, occur continually, and
are utilized with great skill, while such pictures as the Dolphin
Fresco (<a href="#plate_X">Plate X. 1</a>) show the fascination
which marine life had upon the Minoan mind, and the care with which
it was observed. That commerce was thoroughly organized and attended
to with that careful precision which seems to have been characteristic
of the race is seen from the Zakro excavations, where Mr. Hogarth
found 500 seal impressions in the house of a single merchant. Trade
must have been very far removed indeed from primitive conditions
when merchants were so careful about the security of their bales
of goods.

<p class="indent">
So far as the evidence goes, the Minoan Empire does not appear
to have been a specially warlike one. No doubt there was a good
deal of fighting in its history, as was the case with all ancient
empires. But the insular position of Crete, and the predominance
which the Minoan navy established on the sea, saved the island
Empire from the necessity of becoming a great military power, and
the absence of the spirit of militarism is reflected in the <a
name="page_225"><span class="page">Page 225</span></a> national
art. While an Assyrian palace would have been decorated from end
to end with pictures of barbarous bloodshed and plunder, while even
the milder Egyptians would have adorned their walls with records
of the conquests of their Pharaohs, the Kings of the House of Minos
turned to other and more gentle scenes for the decoration of their
homes. Flower-gatherers and dancing-girls, harvest festivals and
religious processions, appealed to their minds far more than the
endless and monotonous succession of horrors with which the Mesopotamian
monarchs delighted to disfigure their walls; and even the dangers
of the bull-ring, as seen on the Knossian frescoes, are mild and
gentle when compared with the abominations where Teumman has his
head sawed off with a short dagger, and other unfortunates are
flayed alive, or have their tongues torn out.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The archives of the palace at Knossos certainly show that a military
force was kept on foot, and was thoroughly organized and well looked
after. There are records of numbers of chariots, and of the issue
of equipments to the charioteers of the force; and many of the
tablets refer to stores of lances, swords, bows, and arrows, a
store of nearly 9,000 arrows being mentioned in one of the finds;
while an actual magazine, containing hundreds of bronze arrow-heads,
has been discovered. We may remember that in ancient warfare the
Cretan bowmen were as famous as the Balearic slingers or the archers
of England. On the whole, however, the <a name="page_226"><span
class="page">Page 226</span></a> genius of the Minoans, like our
own, was more commercial than military, though, no doubt, they
were not devoid of the fighting spirit when occasion arose. Their
kinsmen of Mycen&aelig; and Tiryns, less happily situated, were
forced to develop the military side of life; but the position and
the maritime power of Crete secured for the fortunate island those
long centuries of tranquil growth which were so fruitful in the
arts of peace. With one possible exception, no records appear to
have been found as yet dealing with the Minoan marine; but it is
impossible to believe that a people so methodical, who kept such
careful record of their military stores, should not have had a
thoroughly organized department to deal with the infinitely more
important matter of their navy, and perhaps the records of the
Minoan Board of Admiralty may yet come to light and be deciphered,
to enable us to understand how the first great sea-power of history
dealt with its fleets.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Comparatively few agricultural tools have survived, probably because
few were used; but some bronze sickles have been found. These are
not curved like the modern ones, but are bent at an angle, and
have a longer handle, so that the peasants would not be obliged
to bend down so much in the work of reaping. The figures on the
Harvester Vase carry a curious implement, which has been variously
described, according as those who deal with it believe the vase to
represent a triumphal march of warriors returning from battle or
a harvest procession. <a name="page_227"><span class="page">Page
227</span></a> In the first case it is described as a kind of trident
with a hook attached to it, for the purpose of grappling the rigging
of an opponent's vessel; in the second, it is looked upon as a
common hay-fork. The resemblance to a hay-fork seems satisfactory
enough, though the three prongs are much longer than the two of the
implement used nowadays, and the hook attached remains unexplained;
but if the implement must be supposed to be a military weapon,
it seems singularly ill-contrived and inadequate for such rough
service. It might conceivably be a trident for spearing fish, but,
on the whole, the hay-fork idea seems most satisfactory.

<p class="indent">
Hand-querns were used for the grinding of corn, and numbers of
these and of mortars for pounding grain remain. Indeed, in some
cases the actual grains of barley and the pease which were stored
for future use still remain in the great jars. In a jar at Hissarlik,
Schliemann found no less than 440 pounds of pease, and some of his
workmen lived for a time on this food, which might conceivably
have been stored against a siege of Troy earlier than that recorded
in the Iliad. The olive-tree was of great importance, as yielding
the staple product of the island, and the fig-tree seems also to
have been in general cultivation, and was held to be sacred; but,
strangely enough, though wine must have been in constant use, as
is shown by the vessels for its storage and service, there is only
one representation of the vine, and even in that case the identity
of the object depicted is doubtful. Weaving was an art in <a
name="page_228"><span class="page">Page 228</span></a> which the
Minoans were well skilled, to judge from the fabrics which are
represented in the frescoes. As in Penelope's time, it was a domestic
art, and probably almost every household had its loom, where the
women turned out the materials for ordinary wear. In many of the
houses have been found the loom-weights, mostly of stone or clay,
which took the place of the more modern weaver's beam in serving
to keep the threads taut; and there are also numbers of the stone
discs which were attached, in spinning, to the foot of the spindle, to
keep it straight and in motion. These loom-weights and spindle-discs
are frequently ornamented with spiral incisions.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But the arts in which the islanders were supreme were those of the
potter and the metal-worker, the chief evidences of whose skill
have been already discussed. The reputation of Crete as a centre
of metal-working became legendary in ancient times, and, in all
likelihood, the bronze-worker and his fellows, the gold- and
silver-smiths, attained the height of their skill before their
brethren the potters, since, as we have seen, many of the finest
pottery specimens are obviously designed on bronze, or, at all
events, on metal models, the resemblance even going so far as the
copying of the seams and rivets of the metal originals. Bronze was
smelted in furnaces, the remains of one of which still exist near
Gournia; and was cast in moulds, many of which have survived. The
tools and weapons which were made of the metal show an average alloy
of about <a name="page_229"><span class="page">Page 229</span></a>
ten per cent. of tin. For beaten work, copper in an almost pure
state appears to have been used. Gold was in extensive use for
the best class of ornamental work, and the Vaphio cups, which are
now held to have been imported to Laconia from Crete, are evidence
of the marvellous skill which the Minoan goldsmiths had attained;
while the necklaces and other articles of personal adornment found
at Mokhlos and in the beehive tombs at Ph&aelig;stos (<a
href="#plate_XXXII">Plate XXXII.</a>), are only to be matched, among
ancient work, by the diadems of the Twelfth Dynasty Princesses, found
at Dahshur in Egypt. Silver is comparatively scarce on Minoan, as
on other &AElig;gean sites, though a number of fine silver vessels
have been found at Knossos and elsewhere; and this scarcity is
perhaps due, not only to the greed of the plunderers, but also to
the fact that, during the greater part of the period covered by
the Minoan Empire, the metal itself was actually scarcer and more
valuable than gold. In Egypt, whose supplies of silver apparently
came from Cilicia, it maintained a higher value than gold until
the time of the Eighteenth Dynasty, or about the period of the
fall of Knossos; but then and thereafter its value fell, owing
to increasing supplies, below that of the more precious metal.
It does not appear that the gold-silver alloy&mdash;'electrum,'
of which the Egyptians were so fond&mdash;was used by the Minoans.

<p class="indent">
Of the social life of the people in these prehistoric times we know
practically nothing. Only one inference, <a name="page_230"><span
class="page">Page 230</span></a> possibly precarious enough, may
be made from one of the features of the architecture of Knossos.
There is no attempt to seclude the life of the palace from that
of the town and country around it. On the contrary, the building
seems almost to have been arranged with the view of affording the
citizens of the Minoan Empire every facility for intercourse with
the royal household. The great West Court, with its portico and
its seats along the palace wall, suggests considerable freedom of
access for the populace to the immediate neighbourhood of royalty.
It is perhaps rather a large inference to conclude that 'the very
architecture of the Palaces of Knossos and Ph&aelig;stos may testify
to the power of the democracy';[*] but at least the thoughtfulness
with which the comfort of the people visiting the palace was provided
for, and the general openness and lack of any jealous seclusion,
testified to by the whole style of the buildings, suggest that
the relations between the Kings of the House of Minos and their
subjects were much more human and pleasant than those obtaining
in most ancient kingdoms.
</p>

<p class="footnote">

<p class="indent">
From their art one would, on the whole, conclude the people to
have been a somewhat attractive race, frankly enjoying the more
pleasant aspects of life, and capable of a keen delight in all the
beauties of Nature. Minoan art has little that is sombre about it;
it is redolent of the open air and the free ocean, and a people who
so rejoiced in natural beauty and delighted to surround themselves
with their own reproductions and interpretations of it can scarcely
<a name="page_231"><span class="page">Page 231</span></a> have
been bowed beneath a heavy yoke of servitude, or have lived other
than a comparatively free and independent life. How much the Greeks
of the Classic period imbibed of the spirit of this gifted and
artistic race we can only imagine. The artistic standpoint of the
Hellenic Greek is somewhat different from that of his Minoan or
Mycen&aelig;an forerunner, and he has lost that keen feeling for
Nature which is so conspicuous in the work of the earlier stock;
but the two races are at least at one in that profound love of
beauty which is the dominant characteristic of the Greek nature,
and it may well be that something of that feeling formed part of
the heritage which the conqueror took over from the conquered,
and which, added to the virility and intellectual power of the
northern race, made the historic Greek the most brilliant type of
humanity that the world has ever seen.

CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="subtitle">LETTERS AND RELIGION</p>

<p class="indent">
Of all the discoveries yet made on Cretan soil, that which, in
the end, will doubtless prove to be of the greatest importance is
the discovery of the various systems of writing which the Minoans
successively devised and used. As yet knowledge with regard to these
systems has not advanced beyond the description of the materials
and their comparison with those furnished by other scripts, a task
which has so far been accomplished by Dr. Evans in the first volume
of his 'Scripta Minoa.' An immense amount of material has been
accumulated, and has been separated into various classes, which
have been shown to be characteristic of different periods of Minoan
history. It is possible to arrive at a general understanding of
the matters to which certain items of the material refer, but the
actual reading of the inscribed tablets has as yet proved to be
impossible. To all appearance, moreover, a considerable proportion
of the material appears to be not literary, in any true sense, but
to consist of inventories and accounts, perhaps also of legal <a
name="page_233"><span class="page">Page 233</span></a> documents
and other such records of purely business and practical interest.
Even so it would be a matter of no small importance could it be
found possible to decipher the records, let us say, of the War
Office or Admiralty of Knossos, or to survey the details of royal
house-keeping in those far-off days; and it may still be hoped
that, when the ardently desired bilingual inscription at last turns
up and makes decipherment possible, we may find that documents
of more genuinely literary interest are not altogether lacking.
One thing at least is abundantly clear&mdash;that, as Dr. Evans
put it in the summary of his first year's results, 'that great
early civilization was not dumb,' but, on the contrary, had means
of expression amply adequate to its needs.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In 1894 M. Perrot wrote:[*] 'As at present advised, we can continue
to affirm that for the whole of this period, nowhere, neither in
the Peloponnese nor in Greece proper, no more on the buildings
than on the thousand and one objects of luxury or domestic use that
have come out of the tombs, has there anything been discovered which
resembled any kind of writing.' The statement was perfectly true to
the facts as then known; but it was obviously unthinkable that,
while the Egyptians and Babylonians had their fully developed scripts,
and while ruder races, such as the Hittites, had their systems of
writing, the men who built the splendid walls and palaces of Tiryns
and Mycen&aelig;, and <a name="page_234"><span class="page">Page
234</span></a> wrought the diadems and decorations of the Shaft-Graves,
should have been so far back in one of the chiefest essentials of
human progress as to be unable to communicate with one another
by means of writing. We have already seen how the discoveries of
the first year's work at Knossos settled that question for ever,
and revealed the existence of more than one form of writing. Since
then the material has been rapidly accumulating, and at present the
number of objects&mdash;tablets, labels, and other articles-inscribed
with the various Cretan scripts can be counted by thousands.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote *: Perrot et Chipiez, 'La Gr&egrave;ce primitive: l'Art
myc&eacute;nien,' p. 985.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The earliest form of Minoan writing that can be traced consists of
rude pictographic symbols engraved upon bead-seals and gems. This
primitive pictographic writing is characteristic of the Early Minoan
period, and throughout the succeeding period of Middle Minoan it was
gradually developed into a hieroglyphic system which is believed
to present some analogies to the Hittite form of writing. But in
the latest phases of the Third Middle Minoan period there begins
to appear, at Knossos and elsewhere, a series of inscriptions in a
very different style. The characters are no longer hieroglyphic,
but have become definitely linear, and are arranged very much as
in ordinary writing. In general they are incised upon the clay
tablets of which so many hundreds have been found, but there are
several instances in which they have been written with ink, apparently
with a reed pen, as in the case of the two Middle Minoan III. cups
<a name="page_235"><span class="page">Page 235</span></a> found
at Knossos, which bear linear inscriptions executed before the
clay was fired. While in the case of the hieroglyphic inscriptions
the characters run indifferently from left to right, or from right
to left, in this linear script their fixed direction is the usual
one, from left to right. Suffixes were apparently used to indicate
gender, and pictorial signs indicating the contents of the document
are also in use, though more sparingly than they came to be in
the later form of script. Such signs as occur seem to show that
the documents in which they are found mainly related to matters
of business. The saffron-flower, various vessels, tripods, and
balances, probably for the weighing of precious metals, occur most
frequently among these determinatives.
</p>

<p class="indent">
At Knossos this form of linear writing, Dr. Evans's Class A, appears
to have had a comparatively short vogue. Documents belonging to it
are only found in the particular stratum which is connected with
Middle Minoan III., and are to be dated, according to Dr. Evans's
latest revision of the chronology, not later than 1600 B.C., the
period at which Middle Minoan III. closes. In the Late Minoan periods
which follow, the linear script of Class A is superseded at Knossos
by another form, Class B. In other parts of the island, however,
Class A seems to have survived as a general form of writing much
longer than at Knossos. At Hagia Triada the very large deposits
of linear writing&mdash;larger, indeed, than the representation
of Class A at Knossos&mdash;belong <a name="page_236"><span
class="page">Page 236</span></a> to the First Late Minoan period,
and are contemporary with the wonderful work of the steatite vases
and the fresco of the hunting-cat; while at Ph&aelig;stos the final
catastrophe of the palace took place at a time when the linear
writing of Class A was still in full use. At Zakro, Palaikastro,
Gournia, and elsewhere, examples of this script have been found,
showing that it was prevalent, at all events, throughout Central
and Eastern Crete; and in all cases it is associated with remains
which belong to the close of Middle Minoan III. and the beginnings
of the Late Minoan period. But it would appear that this form of
writing was not confined to Crete, but was more widely diffused.
Traces of it, or of a script very closely allied with it, have
been found at Thera, while at Phylakopi in Melos evidence has come
to light of a whole series of marks closely corresponding to the
Cretan Class A. This would seem to suggest what in itself is entirely
probable, that the language used in Minoan Crete was predominant,
or at all events was understood and largely used, throughout the
&AElig;gean area. The inscription on the libation table found by
Dr. Evans at the Dict&aelig;an Cave belongs to this class, and also
that upon the similar object found by Mr. Currelly at Palaikastro.

<p class="indent">
When, at the beginning of the Late Minoan period, the Palace of
Knossos was remodelled, another great change accompanied the
architectural one. This was the entire supersession of the linear
script, Class A, by another similar but independent form, which has
been named Class B. Somewhat <a name="page_237"><span class="page">Page
237</span></a> remarkably, although the specimens of the script
discovered at the Palace of Knossos and its immediate dependencies
are far more numerous than those of Class A, the use of Class B
seems, so far as the evidence yet collected goes, to have been
entirely confined to Knossos. The beginning of the use of this system
may have been in the early part of the fifteenth century B.C.,
and it was in full service at the great catastrophe of Knossos,
at the end of the fifteenth or beginning of the fourteenth century
B.C. Its use still continued after the fall of the Minoan power,
tablets inscribed with this form of writing being found in the Late
Minoan III. House of the Fetish Shrine at Knossos. According to
Dr. Evans, whose 'Scripta Minoa' sums up all that is at present
known of these enigmatic Cretan writings, Class B is not a mere
outgrowth of Class A. The scripts are certainly allied, and there are
indications that B is the more highly developed of the two, having
a smaller selection of characters and a less complicated system of
compound signs; but at the same time several of the signs found
in B do not occur in A at all, and some of those which belong to
both scripts are found in a more primitive form in B. The language
expressed in both scripts must, however, have been essentially
the same. It is suggested, therefore, that in the supersession
of Class A by Class B we have another indication of the dynastic
revolution which is supposed to have caused that ruin of the palace
which closed the Middle Minoan period.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The records of Class B give evidence of a <a name="page_238"><span
class="page">Page 238</span></a> very considerable advance in the
art of writing. 'The characters themselves have a European aspect.
They are of upright habit, and of a simple and definite outline,
which throws into sharp relief the cumbrous and obscure cuneiform
system of Babylonia. Although not so cursive in form as the Hieratic
or Demotic types of Egyptian writing, there is here a much more
limited selection of types. It would seem that the characters stood
for syllables or even letters, though they could in most cases
also be used as words.... The spaces and lines between the words,
the <i>espacement</i> into distinct paragraphs, and the variation
in the size of the characters on the same tablet, according to the
relative importance of the text, show a striving after clearness
and method such as can by no means be said to be a characteristic
of Classical Greek inscriptions.'[*] A decimal system of numbers
was in use, the highest single amount referred to being 19,000,
and percentages were evidently well understood, as a whole series
of tablets is devoted to them.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote *: 'Scripta Minoa,' pp. 39, 40.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
The tablets themselves were originally of unburnt, but sun-dried,
clay, and their preservation, as we have seen, is probably due to
the excessive heat to which they were exposed during the great
fire which destroyed the palace. 'Fire itself, so fatal to other
libraries, has thus insured the preservation of the archives of
Minoan Knossos.' Great care was plainly bestowed upon the storage
of the tablets. <a name="page_239"><span class="page">Page
239</span></a> They were stored in chests and coffers of various
materials, and were evidently carefully separated according to
the different departments to which their contents referred. In
one deposit near the northern entrance, which was the 'Sea-Gate'
of the palace, the largest of the seatings which had secured the
cases in which the tablets were stored bore a representation of a
ship, possibly an indication of the fact that these tablets belonged
to the Minoan Board of Admiralty. One set of tablets had been stored
in a room which presents all the appearance of having been an office,
and the frequent occurrence in this deposit of the figures of a
horse's head, a chariot, and a cuirass, suggests that the store
belonged to the Minoan War Office, and refers to the equipment
of the Chariot Brigade of the Knossian army.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Further evidence of the business-like methods of the Minoan officials
was given by the fact that many of the seals belonging to the various
stores were countermarked on the face, and had their backs countersigned
and endorsed, evidently by examining officials, while they appear to
have been regularly filed and docketed for reference. Indeed, the
Minoan methods have already borne the test of having been accepted
as evidence in a modern court of law. 'In 1901,' says Dr. Evans,
'I discovered that certain tablets had been abstracted from the
excavations, and had shortly afterwards been purchased by the museum
at Athens. It further appeared that one of our workmen&mdash;a
certain <a name="page_240"><span class="page">Page 240</span></a>
Aristides&mdash;had left the excavation about the same time for
Greece, and had been seen in Athens offering "antikas" for sale
under suspicious circumstances. On examining the inscriptions on
the stolen tablets I observed a formula that showed that some or
all of the pieces belonged to a deposit found in Magazine XV. A
reference to our daybooks brought out the fact that the same Aristides
had taken part in the excavation of this particular magazine a
little before the date of his hasty departure. On his return to
Crete, some months later, he was accordingly arrested, and the
evidence supplied by the Minoan formula was accepted by the Candia
Tribunal as a crowning proof of his guilt. Aristides&mdash;"the
Unjust"&mdash;was thus condemned to three months' imprisonment.'
Few criminals attain to the dignity of being convicted on evidence
3,500 years old.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Certain of the tablets contain lists of persons of both sexes,
apparently denoted by their personal names, the signs which appear
to stand for the name being followed in each case by an ideograph
which is the determinative of 'man,' or 'woman,' as the case may
be. It is, of course, impossible to say as yet to what rank or class
the people thus catalogued may have belonged; but the conjecture
may be hazarded that these lists may be the major-domo's records
of the male and female slaves of the household, or perhaps of the
artisans who appear to have dwelt within the precincts of the palace.
Another type of record is given by tablets such as that represented
<a name="page_241"><span class="page">Page 241</span></a> in <a
href="#plate_XIV">Plate XIV</a>. The tablet contains eight lines
of well-written inscription, and consists apparently of twenty
words, divided into three paragraphs. In this case there are no
determinatives and no numerals; and it is possible that the document
may be a contract, or perhaps an official proclamation.

That such tablets were not the only form in which the Minoans executed
the writing of their various documents is evident from the fact
already noticed, that inscriptions have been found executed with a
reed-pen, and, though those extant are written on clay vessels, it
is obvious that the reed-pen was not a very suitable instrument for
writing on such materials, and that its existence presupposes some
substance more adapted to the cursive writing of a pen&mdash;parchment,
possibly, or papyrus, which could be readily obtained from Egypt.
Unfortunately, such materials, on which, in all probability, the
real literary documents of the Minoans, if there were any such
documents, would be written, can scarcely have survived the fire
which destroyed the palace, or, if by any chance they escaped that,
the subsequent action of the climate; so that whatever genuinely
literary fragments may yet come to light must be looked for on the
larger tablets, and at the best can scarcely be more than brief
extracts. We cannot expect from Crete a wealth of papyri such as
Egypt has preserved for the arch&aelig;ologist.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Into quite a different category from any of the ordinary Minoan
tablets comes the disc found at Ph&aelig;stos in 1908. Its general
character has been <a name="page_242"><span class="page">Page
242</span></a> already described. The long inscription which covers
both of its faces is written in a form of hieroglyphics which, to
some extent, resembles the Minoan pictographic system, but is not
the same. The crested helmets which occur frequently as signs, the
round shields, the fashion of dress of both men and women, and the
style of architecture depicted in the hieroglyphic rendering of a
house or pagoda, are not Minoan; and, on the whole, the evidence
seems to point to the disc being the product of some allied culture,
perhaps Lycian, in which a language closely akin to that of Minoan
Crete was used. The inscription on the disc is carefully balanced
and arranged, and each side contains exactly the same number of
sign-groups, with one additional group on face A, which is separated
from the preceding part of the inscription by a dash. Certain sets
of sign-groups recur in the same order, as though they constituted
some kind of refrain. From these indications it has been suggested
that the whole inscription is a metrical composition, a short poem
or hymn&mdash;perhaps one leaf of an Anatolian Book of Psalms whose
other pages have perished. It is agreed that the language and religion
of the western coast of Asia Minor were closely allied to those of
Crete, and it is possible that when the Minoans developed their
own language on somewhat different lines from the mainlanders,
they maintained in parts of their religious service the old form
of the speech common to themselves and their Anatolian relatives,
as a kind of sacred language.[*]

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_243"><span class="page">Page 243</span></a> Thus,
it is abundantly evident that the civilization of Minoan Crete,
far from being dumb, had varied and perfectly adequate means of
expressing itself. The old Cretan tradition that the Ph&oelig;nicians
did not invent the letters of the alphabet, but only changed those
already existing, is amply justified; for this seems to have been
precisely what they did. The Ph&oelig;nician mind, if not original,
was at all events practical. The great stumbling-block in the way of
the ancient scripts was their complexity&mdash;a fault which the
Minoan users of the Linear Script, Class B, had evidently already
begun to recognize and endeavour to amend. What the Ph&oelig;nicians
did was to carry the process of simplification farther still, and to
appropriate for their own use out of the elements already existing
around them a conveniently short and simple system of signs. The
position which they came to occupy, after the Minoan empire of the
sea had passed away, as the great carriers and middlemen of the
Mediterranean, gave their system a spread and a utility possible to
no other system of writing; and so the Ph&oelig;nician alphabet
gradually came to take its place as the basis of all subsequent
scripts. Unquestionably it was a great and important service which
was thus rendered by them; but, all the same, the beginnings of
European writing must be traced not to them, but to their
predecessors the Minoans, and the clay tablets of Knossos,
Ph&aelig;stos, and Hagia Triada are the lineal ancestors of all
the written literature of Europe.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page_244"><span class="page">Page 244</span></a> In attempting
to deal with the Minoan religion we are met by the fact that it
is as yet quite impossible to present any connected view of the
subject. As in the case of their literature we have the actual
records but cannot read them, so in the case of their religion
a considerable mass of facts is apparent, but we have no means
of co-ordinating them so as to arrive at any definite idea of a
religious system. Some of the ritual we can see, and even understand
something of the Divinity to whom it was addressed, but the theology
is lacking. Accordingly, nothing more can be done than to present
the fragmentary facts which are apparent.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The Minoans, it seems fairly clear, were never, like their successors
the Greeks, the possessors of a well-peopled Pantheon; nor was the
chief object of their adoration a male deity like the Greek Zeus.
There are, indeed, traces of a male divinity, who was adopted by
the Greeks when they obtained predominance in the island, as the
representative of their own supreme deity, and who became the Cretan
Zeus. But in Minoan times this being occupied a very subordinate place,
and undoubtedly the chief object of worship was a goddess&mdash;a
Nature Goddess, a Great Mother&mdash; &pi;&omicron;&tau;&nu;&iota;&alpha;
&theta;&eta;&rho;&omega;&nu;, the Lady of the Wild Creatures&mdash;who
was the source of all life, higher and lower, its guardian during the
period of its earthly existence, and its ruler in the underworld.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The functions of this great deity, it has been aptly pointed out,
are substantially those claimed for herself <a name="page_245"><span
class="page">Page 245</span></a> by Artemis in Browning's poem,
'Artemis Prologizes':
</p>

<p class="bquote">
'Through heaven I roll my lucid moon along;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I shed in hell o'er my pale people peace;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;On earth, I, caring for the creatures, guard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Each pregnant yellow wolf and fox-bitch sleek,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And every feathered mother's callow brood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all that love green haunts and loneliness.'
</p>

<p class="indent">
She was a goddess alike of the air, the earth, and the underworld, and
representations of her have survived in which her various attributes
are expressed. As goddess of the air, she is represented by a female
figure crowned with doves; as goddess of the underworld, her emblems
are the snakes, which we see twined round the fa&iuml;ence figure
at Knossos, or the terra-cotta in the Gournia shrine. Her figure
is often seen upon seals and gems, standing on the top of the rock
or mountain, with guardian lions in attendance, one on either side,
and sometimes with a male votary in the background.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The earliest form of her worship, and one which proved very persistent,
was apparently aniconic. The divinity was not embodied in any graven
image, but was inherent in such objects as the rude natural concretions
found in the House of the Fetish Shrine, or was supposed to dwell
in sacred trees, on which sometimes perch the doves which indicate
that the goddess is present as ruler of the air, or which are twined
with serpents, showing her presence as goddess of the earth and
underworld. In the place <a name="page_246"><span class="page">Page
246</span></a> of sacred trees we have often sacred pillars, which
seem to have been objects of worship down to Late Minoan II. at
least, since in the Royal Villa at Knossos, dating from this period,
there is a pillar-room similar to the much earlier pillar-rooms
of the Great Palace. The little group of three pillars found at
Knossos evidently represents the divinity in her aspect as a heavenly
goddess, for the pillars have doves perching upon their capitals.
Sometimes, as in the case of the Lion Gate at Mycen&aelig;, and
other representations, we have the pillar with the two supporting
lions, an anticipation of the anthropomorphic figure of the goddess
on the rock. It is possible that in some cases the figures of the
Double Axes standing between horns of consecration were also looked
upon as embodiments of the divinity. A similar mode of representing
deity occurs in the earlier stages of many religions, and the sacred
pillar set up by Jacob at Bethel may be instanced as an example
of its presence in the beginnings of the Hebrew worship.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In general the Minoan Great Mother appears to have been looked
upon as a being of beneficence, and as the giver of 'every good
and perfect gift'; but her association with the lion and the snake
shows that there was also a more mysterious and awful side to her
character. When the later Greeks came into the island and found
this deity in possession, she became identified, in the various
aspects of her many-sided nature, with various goddesses of the
Hellenic Pantheon. Foremost and specially <a name="page_247"><span
class="page">Page 247</span></a> she became Rhea, the mother of
the gods, who had fled to Crete to bear her son Zeus. Otherwise
she was Hera, the sister and the spouse of Zeus, and in this case
the story of the marriage of the great goddess and the supreme god
probably represents the fusion of religious ideas on the part of
the two races, the conquerors taking over the deity of the conquered
race, and uniting her with the Sky God whom they had brought with
them from their Northern home. She also survived as Aphrodite,
as Demeter, and, in her capacity as Lady of the Wild Beasts, as
Artemis.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The suggestion of the association of Zeus with the Minoan goddess
may have been given to the Northern conquerors by a feature of the
Cretan religion which they found already in existence. On certain
seal impressions and engraved gems there are indications that the
great Nature Goddess was sometimes associated with a male divinity.
This being, however, seems to have occupied an obscure and inferior
position. In most of the scenes in which he is represented he,
is either in the background, or reverentially stands before the
seated female divinity. It would appear that the Ach&aelig;ans
appropriated this insignificant god as the representative of their
own Zeus, attributed to him birth from the Great Goddess in her own
cave-sanctuary of Dicte, and endowed him with many of the attributes
which she had formerly possessed, including the Double Axe emblem
of sovereignty, so that in Hellenic times the supreme deity of
the island was always the Cretan Zeus, <a name="page_248"><span
class="page">Page 248</span></a> Zeus of the Double Axe, though
in reality he was no Cretan god at all, or at best a secondary
divinity, dressed in borrowed plumes and with greatness thrust upon
him.
</p>

<p class="indent">
As to the forms of worship with which the Great Mother of Crete was
served, comparatively little is known. The most striking feature
is the seemingly total absence of what we should call temples.
In this respect Crete presents a curious contrast to Egypt: in
Egypt we have an abundance of vast temples, but practically no
surviving palaces; in Crete the case is exactly reversed, and we
have huge palaces but no temples. The reason of this appears to
be, as Dr. Mackenzie has pointed out,[*] that the Minoan religion
was of an entirely domestic character. 'At Knossos all shrines
are either house-shrines or palace-shrines. The divinities are
household and dynastic divinities having an ancestral character
and an ancestral reputation to maintain.' To put it in a word,
worship in the Minoan religion was essentially Family Worship.
No doubt there were public ceremonials also, in which the King,
who seems to have been Priest as well as King (if, indeed, he was
not viewed as an incarnation of deity), performed the principal
part; but there can have been nothing like the habitual publicity
of parts of the worship of the god which was contemplated in the
great peristyle courts of the Egyptian temples and the processional
arrangements of part of their service. 'At Knossos,' says Dr. <a
name="page_249"><span class="page">Page 249</span></a> Mackenzie,
'we found, as a matter of fact, that there was a tendency for each
house to have a room set apart for family worship. Of such shrines
the palace was found to have more than one. Those shrines were
found to be in a very private part of the house, and usually to
have no thoroughfare through them.'
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote *: <i>Annual of the British School at Athens</i>, vol.
xiv., p. 366.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
What these shrines were like we may to some extent judge from the
fragmentary fresco found at Knossos, representing one of the
pillar-shrines where the Great Goddess was worshipped in her emblems
of the sacred pillars. The structure consists of a taller central
chamber, with a lower wing on either side of it. The material of
which it is built is apparently wood, faced and decorated in certain
parts with chequer-work in black-and-white plaster. The whole building
rests upon large blocks of stone, immediately above which in the
central chamber comes a solid piece of building, adorned first
with the chequer-work, and then, above this, with two half-rosettes
bordered with <i>kuanos</i>. Over this rises the open chamber of
the shrine, which contains nothing but two pillars of the familiar
Minoan-Mycen&aelig;an type, tapering downwards from the capitals.
These rise from between the sacred horns, which occur in practically
every religious scene as emblems of consecration (<i>cf.</i> the
'horns of the altar' in the Hebrew temple worship). The lower chambers
on either side contain each a single pillar, again rising from
between the horns of consecration. A Minoan lady, dressed in a gown
of bluish-green, sits with her back to the wall of the right-hand
lower chamber, and the scale of the <a name="page_250"><span
class="page">Page 250</span></a> shrine is given by the fact that,
her seat being on the same level as the floor of the chamber, her
head is in a line with the roof beam which rests on the capital
of the sacred pillar. The remains of an actual shrine discovered
in 1907 close to the Central Court at Knossos show that the fresco
does not exaggerate the smallness of the sacred buildings. The
Gournia shrine, situated in the centre of the town, is about twelve
feet square, and its discoverer believes that the walls of the
sacred enclosure may never have stood more than eighteen inches
high. Here, again, were the horns of consecration, the doves, and
the snakes twined round the image of the goddess.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Of what sort were the acts of worship in connection with the Minoan
Religion? Sacrifice was certainly prominent, and the bull was probably
the chief victim offered to the goddess. In one of the scenes on
the Hagia Triada sarcophagus, a bull is being sacrificed, and his
blood is dripping into a vessel placed beneath his head. Behind is
the figure of a woman, whose hands are stretched out, presumably
to hold the cords with which the victim is bound. Two kids crouch
on the ground below the bull, perhaps to be offered in their turn.
Libation also formed part of the ceremonial, and on the same sarcophagus
there are two scenes in which it occurs. In the one instance (<a
href="#plate_XXVIII">Plate XXVIII.</a>), the vessel into which
the offering is being poured stands between two sacred Double Axes
with birds perched upon them; in the other the libation-vessel
stands upon an altar with a Double Axe behind it. The three <a
name="page_251"><span class="page">Page 251</span></a> receptacles
of the Dict&aelig;an Libation Table suggest a threefold offering
like that of mingled milk and honey, sweet wine, and water, which,
in the Homeric period, was made to the Shades of the Dead and to
the Nymphs.
</p>

<p class="indent">
As was perhaps natural in the cult of a goddess, the chief part
in the ritual seems to have been taken by priestesses. Men share
in the ceremonies also, but not so frequently, and apparently in
subordinate r&ocirc;les. Part of the ritual evidently consisted
of dancing, and music also had its place, as is evident from the
figures of the lyre and flute players on the sarcophagus of Hagia
Triada. The question of whether the Minoans had any worship of
ancesters or sacrifice to the dead is raised by several relics.
Above the Shaft-Graves at Mycen&aelig; stood a circular altar,
where offerings must have been made either to the Shades of the
Dead or on behalf of them, and the scenes on the Hagia Triada
sarcophagus, resembling so curiously those of the Egyptian ceremony
of 'the Opening of the Mouth,' suggest a belief in the continued
existence of the spirit, either as an object to be propitiated
by sacrifice, or as a being which needed to be sustained in its
disembodied state by offerings of meat and drink.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The relation of the Minoan King to the religion of his country
is a point of some interest, though the facts known are scarcely
sufficient to afford ground for more than surmise. The very structure
of the palace at Knossos gives evidence of the importance of the part
which he played in spiritual matters, and <a name="page_252"><span
class="page">Page 252</span></a> of the intimate connection which
existed in the Minoan, as in so many other ancient faiths, between
Royalty and Religion. There are not only several shrines and altars
in the palace, but it is probable, as Dr. Mackenzie has pointed
out,[*] that the so-called bathrooms at Knossos and Ph&aelig;stos
are not bathrooms at all, but small chapels or oratories, so that
altogether religion bulks very largely in the arrangements of the
Royal dwelling. In fact, the Kings and Queens of Knossos were
Priest-Kings and Priest-Queens, the heads of the spiritual as well as
of the material life of their people; and it is not at all unlikely,
from what is known of the religious views of other ancient peoples,
that the Priest-King was looked upon as an incarnation of divinity.
If so, of what divinity? It is here that, in all likelihood, we
get near the heart of the Minotaur legend. 'The characteristic
mythical monster of Crete,' says Miss Jane Harrison,[**] 'was the
bull-headed Minotaur. Behind the legend of Pasiphae, made monstrous
by the misunderstanding of immigrant conquerors, it can scarcely be
doubted that there lurks some sacred mystical ceremony of ritual wedlock
(&iota;&epsilon;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf; &gamma;&alpha;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf;)
with a primitive bull-headed divinity.... The bull-Dionysos of Thrace,
when he came to Crete, found a monstrous god, own cousin to himself....
Of the ritual of the bull-god in Crete, we know that it consisted in
part of the tearing and eating of a bull, <a name="page_253"><span
class="page">Page 253</span></a> and behind is the dreadful suspicion
of human sacrifice.' The actual evidence found on Minoan sites for the
existence of such a bull-headed divinity is somewhat slight, the
clearest instance being a seal-impression from Knossos, representing
a monster who bears an animal head, possibly a bull's, upon a human
body, and who is evidently regarded as divine, since he is seated and
reverently approached by a human worshipper; but, taken in connection
with the universal currency of the Minotaur legend, it is probably
sufficient. What relation this monstrous divinity held to the other
objects of Minoan worship is not apparent.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote *: <i>Annual of the British School at Athens</i>, xiv.,
p. 366. The suggestion is also made by Mosso, 'The Palaces of Crete,'
pp. 64-66.]

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote **: 'Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion,' pp.

</p>

<p class="indent">
It may be, then, that this deity was the one of whom the King was
supposed to be the representative and incarnation, and in that
case the bull-grappling, which was so constant a feature of the
palace sports, had a deeper significance, and was in reality part of
the ceremonial associated with the worship of the Cretan bull-god.
In this connection Professor Murray has emphasized[*] certain facts
in connection with the legendary history of Minos, which would
seem to link the Cretan monarchy with a custom not infrequently
observed in connection with other ancient monarchies and faiths.
It will be remembered that the legend of Minos states variously
that he 'ruled for nine years, the gossip of Great Zeus,' and that
every nine years he went into the cave of Zeus or of the bull-god,
to converse with Zeus, to receive new commandments, and to <a
name="page_254"><span class="page">Page 254</span></a> give account
of his stewardship. The nine-year period recurs in the account
of the bloody tribute of seven youths and seven maidens who were
offered to the Minotaur every ninth year. May we not, therefore,
have in these statements a distorted recollection of the fact that
the Royal Incarnation of the Bull-God originally held his office
only for a term of nine years, and that at the end of that period
he went into the Dict&aelig;an Cave, the sanctuary of his divinity,
and was there slain in sacrifice, while from the cave his successor
came forth, and was hailed as the rejuvenated incarnation of divinity,
to reign in his turn, and then to perish as his predecessor had
done? In this case the seven youths and seven maidens who were
offered to the Minotaur at the end of the nine-year period may
have been slain with him to be his companions and servants in the
underworld, or, as is perhaps more likely, they may, in a later
stage of the custom, have been accepted as his substitutes, so
that the death of the King was merely a ritual one.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote *: 'The Rise of the Greek Epic,' pp. 127, 128.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Of course, this explanation of the Minos legend and the story of
the human tribute is in the meantime only a supposition, and not
susceptible of absolute proof; but the constant recurrence of the
nine-year period is, at least, very striking, and it is worth
remembering that a custom precisely similar to that suggested has
existed in connection with several ancient monarchies, and, indeed,
survives to the present day. In the ancient Ethiopian kingdom the
King was obliged to slay himself when commanded to do so by the
priests. A similar custom <a name="page_255"><span class="page">Page
255</span></a> prevailed in Babylonia and among the ancient Prussians,
while several modern African tribes slay their King when the first
sign of age or infirmity begins to show itself in him. Professor
Flinders Petrie has shown[*] that the greatest of the Egyptian
feasts, the 'Sed' Festival, was a ceremonial survival of a time
when the Pharaoh, the Priest-King and representative of God on
earth, was slain at fixed intervals. The object in all such cases
is manifestly to secure that the incarnation of divinity shall
always be in the prime of his vigour, and shall never know decay.
It is impossible, no doubt, to say that such a feature belonged to
the Minoan religious polity; the evidence is not such as to admit
of certainty, yet it is not unlikely that in a custom similar to
this lies the interpretation of the main features of the Minotaur
legend.

<p class="indent">
Such, then, was the Empire of the Minoan Sea-Kings as it has been
revealed to us by the excavations and researches of the last ten
years. Apart from the actual information gained of this great race,
which must henceforward be regarded as one of the originating sources
of Greek civilization and learning, and therefore, to a great extent,
of all European culture, perhaps the most striking and interesting
result that has been attained is the remarkable confirmation given to
the broad outlines of those traditions about Crete which have survived
in the legends and in the narratives of the Greek historians. The fable
of the Minotaur is now seen to be no mere <a name="page_256"><span
class="page">Page 256</span></a> wild and monstrous imagining,
but a reflection, vague and grotesque as seen through the mist of
centuries, of customs which did actually exist in the palace life
of Knossos, and were very probably parts of the religious practice
of the country. The slaying of the Minotaur by the Athenian Theseus
may well be an echo of the conquest of the Minoan Empire by the
mainland tribes. The story which makes Theseus bring up from the
Palace of Amphitrite the ring which Minos had thrown into the sea,
seems almost certainly to be a symbolic expression of the passing
over of the sea-power of the &AElig;gean from the once-omnipotent
Minoans to the Ach&aelig;ans and the other restless tribes who for
generations after the fall of Knossos held the dominion of the
ocean, and were the terror of all peaceful nations, and a menace to
the existence of even so great a power as Egypt. No one now dreams
of hesitating to accept the statements of Herodotus and Thucydides
as to the great sea-empire of Crete. Whoever the Minos to whom
they allude may have been&mdash;whether he was actually a single
great historical monarch who brought the glory of the kingdom to its
culmination, or whether the name was the title of a race of Kings,
is a matter of small moment. In either case the sea-power of Minoan
Crete was a reality which endured, not for one reign, but for many
reigns; and it is practically certain that, during a long period
of history, the whole sea-borne trade of Europe, Asia, and Africa,
was in the hands of these, the earliest lords of the ocean.

<p class="indent">
The recollections of the fallen power that survived <a
name="page_257"><span class="page">Page 257</span></a> in the Greek
mind were chiefly those connected with the oppressive aspect of the
dominion which the Lord of Knossos exercised over the &AElig;gean
area; but in Egypt there lingered for centuries a tradition which did
more justice to the glories of Minoan Crete. In the Tim&aelig;us,
Plato tells a story of how Solon went to Egypt, and was told by
a priest at Sais that long ago there had been a great island in
the western sea, where a wonderful central power held sway, not
only over the whole of its own land, but also over other islands
and parts of the continent. In an attempt at universal conquest,
this island State made war upon Greece and Egypt, but was defeated
by the Athenians, and overwhelmed by the sea as a punishment for its
sins, leaving only a range of mud-banks, dangerous to navigation,
to mark the place where it had been. In the Tim&aelig;us and Critias,
Plato describes with considerable detail the features of the island
State, and the details are such that he might almost have been
describing what the Egyptian priest who originally told the story
was no doubt endeavouring to describe&mdash;the actual port and
Palace of Knossos, with the life that went on there. 'The great
harbour, for example, with its shipping and its merchants coming
from all parts, the elaborate bathrooms, the stadium, and the solemn
sacrifice of a bull, are all thoroughly, though not exclusively,
Minoan; but when we read how the bull is hunted "in the temple of
Poseidon without weapons but with staves and nooses," we have an
unmistakable description of the bull-ring at Knossos, the very thing
which struck foreigners <a name="page_258"><span class="page">Page
258</span></a> most, and which gave rise to the legend of the
Minotaur.'[*]

<p class="indent">
The boundaries which Plato assigns to the Empire of the lost State
are practically identical with those over which Minoan influence is
now known to have spread, while the description of the island itself
is such as to make it almost certain that Crete was the original
from which it was drawn. 'The island was the way to other islands,
and from these islands you might pass to the whole of the opposite
continent which surrounded the true ocean.' So Plato describes
Atlantis; and when you set beside his sentence a modern description of
Crete&mdash;'a half-way house between three continents, flanked by the
great Libyan promontory, and linked by smaller island stepping-stones
to the Peloponnese and the mainland of Anatolia'&mdash;there can be
little doubt that the two descriptions refer to the same island.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The only difficulty in the way of accepting the identification is
that it is stated that the lost Atlantis lay beyond the Pillars
of Hercules; but doubtless this statement is due to Solon's
misinterpretation of what was said by his Egyptian informant, or to
the Saite priest's endeavour to accommodate his ancient tradition
to the wider geographical knowledge of his own time. The old Egyptian
conception of the universe held that the heavens were supported
on four pillars, which were actual mountains; and probably the
original story placed <a name="page_259"><span class="page">Page
259</span></a> the lost island beyond these pillars as a metaphorical
way of stating that it was very far distant, as indeed it was to
voyagers in those early days. But by Solon's time the limits of
navigation were extended far beyond those of the early seafarers.
The Ph&oelig;nician trader had pushed at least as far west as Spain;
Necho's fleet had circumnavigated Africa; and so 'the island farthest
west,' which naturally meant Crete to the Egyptian of the Eighteenth
Dynasty who first recorded the catastrophe of the Minoan Empire,
had to be thrust out beyond the Straits of Gibraltar to satisfy
the wider ideas of the men of Solon's and Necho's time.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Almost certainly then, Plato's story gives the Saite version of the
actual Egyptian records of the greatness and the final disaster of
that great island state with which Egypt so long maintained intercourse.
Doubtless to the men of the latter part of the Eighteenth Dynasty the
sudden blotting out of Minoan trade and influence by the overthrow
of Knossos seemed as strange and mysterious as though Crete had
actually been swallowed up by the sea. The island never regained
its lost supremacy, and gradually sank into the insignificance
which is its characteristic throughout the Classical period. So,
though neither the priest of Sais nor his Greek auditor, and still
less Plato, dreamed of the fact, the wonderful island State of which
the Egyptian tradition preserved the memory, was indeed Minoan
Crete, and the men of the Lost Atlantis whose portraits Produs saw
in Egypt were none other than the Keftiu of the tombs of Sen-mut
and Rekh-ma-ra.

CHRONOLOGICAL SUMMARY</h2>

<p class="indent">
Prior to 1580 B.C. the dates in the summary must be regarded as
merely provisional, and the margin of possible error is wide. The
tendency on the part of the Cretan explorers has been to accept
in the main the Berlin system of Egyptian dating in preference
to that advocated by Professor Flinders Petrie ('Researches in
Sinai,' pp. 163-185), on the ground that the development of the
Minoan culture can scarcely have required so long a period as that
given by the Sinai dating. It must be remembered, however, that
the question is still unsettled, and that the longer system of
Professor Petrie must be regarded as at least possible.

APPENDIX</h2>

<p class="subtitle">TRANSLATIONS OF THE PH&AElig;STOS DISK</p>

<p class="indent">
Two translations of the Ph&aelig;stos disk have been put forward.
The first is by Professor George Hempl, of Stanford University,
U.S.A., and appeared in <i>Harper's Magazine</i> for January, 1911,
under the title, 'The Solving of an Ancient Riddle.' The second,
by Miss F. Melian Stawell, of Newnham College, appeared in the
<i>Burlington Magazine</i> of April, 1911, under the title, 'An
Interpretation of the Phaistos Disk.'
</p>

<p class="indent">
Both are characterized by considerable ingenuity; but the trouble is
that they do not agree in the very least. Professor Hempl maintains
that the disk is the record of a dedication of oxen at a shrine in
Ph&aelig;stos, in atonement of a robbery perpetrated by Cretan
sea-rovers on some shrine of the great goddess in Asia Minor. Miss
Stawell, on the other hand, believes that the disk is the matrix
for casting a pair of cymbals, and that the inscription is the
invocation which the worshippers had to chant to the goddess.
</p>

<p class="indent">
A comparison of portions of the two renderings will at least show
that certainty can scarcely be said to have been reached. Professor
Hempl thus renders the opening lines of Face A:
</p>

<p class="indent">
'Lo, Xipho the prophetess dedicates spoils from a spoiler of the
prophetess. Zeus, guard us. In silence put aside the most dainty
portions of the still unroasted animal. Athene Minerva, be gracious.
Silence! The victims have been put to death. Silence!'
</p>

<p class="indent">
Compare Miss Stawell's translation of the same lines:
</p>

<p class="indent">
'Lady, 0 hearken! Cunning one! Ah, Queen! I will sing, Lady, oh,
thou must deliver! Divine One, mighty Queen! Divine One, Giver of
Rain! Lady, Mistress, Come! Lady, be gracious! Goddess, be merciful!
Behold, Lady, I call on thee with the clash! Athena, behold, Warrior!
Help! Lady, come! Lady&mdash;keep silence, I sacrifice&mdash;Lady,
come!'

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
